Acorn Women's Snowline Mule Slipper;B0076UAIMW;[0, 0];3.0;I got these slippers because I was tired of having to buy new slippers every month or two. I searched around looking for quality slippers and found these. Many people said how comfortable they were and how long they last for. For the price they cost I expected them to last much longer than they did for me. Maybe I use slippers more because I'm home and where them when I walk around the house, I guess more than others but wow for what I paid, I should have at least gotten maybe 6 months to a year out of them but nope. Its now time to find a new pair of slippers but I don't think I'm going through Acorn again nor I'm a paying so much for them either.;06 27, 2014;ARKGUYYA6SZ1D;SupermansLois;They're great at first;1403827200
Barilla Marinara Penne Italian Entree, 9 Ounce Microwavable Bowls (Pack of 6);B0076YVPLG;[3, 4];3.0;I tried both this variety and the tomato and basil variety, and I can definitely say that I preferred this one.  The sauce has a slightly spicy flavor which is pleasant, and adds a bit of interest.  This is hardly the most amazing pasta meal I've ever had, but it is undeniably convenient- microwaves in a minute and no refrigeration needed.  I found it useful for a particularly busy day at work.  I could see myself eating this again on similar days, but it's not really tasty enough that I would go out of my way to eat it at other times.  I consider these meals sort of similar to energy bars- they're not all that great, but they get the job done.;11 1, 2012;A3R9H6OKZHHRJD;LH422;A bit of spice;1351728000
"Samsung Galaxy Note Flip Cover Case - White (Compatible with AT&amp;T i717 and T-Mobile T879)";B0076Z3EA0;[0, 0];5.0;While buying the flip case I was a bit skeptical reading all the negative comments and I was all set to return the package if needed. I don't know why lots of people are complaining but my one fits well. The Pink color is not the same shade as shown in the picture however its a cute pink color so I don't mind using it. The package says original SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE case while its quiet cheap compared to what you get in Bestbuy.

;B007704Y08;[0, 0];5.0;"After readingThe Killing Moon (Dreamblood)(book #1 in Dreamblood series) who had a tough start for me, I was wary to continue this series and delayed reading The Shadowed Sun for almost a year. Honestly, I would probably still have it on my tbr shelf, if Christina didn't give me a little push... I am sorry now that I waited so long. The Shadowed Sun was so good I could not let it out of my hands. You know when you move your Kindle with you from room to room, so whenever you have a little bit of free time you can jump in and continue reading? Yeah, I was hooked that bad.I don't know how to begin and describe The Shadowed Sun. InThe Killing Moon (Dreamblood)I was awed with the world that N.K. Jemisin created - but there was a downside to that originality. Everything was so unfamiliar that I had trouble relating to the characters. Their culture and prejudice were completely different than ours. In fact, first 10% ofThe Killing Moon (Dreamblood)were really hard to read until I started to at least a little bit comprehend city of Gujaareh. But The Shadowed Sun has much smoother start (or I was already familiar with the world) so it took less time for me to get totally involved into a story.So for those who didn't run away on the mention of epic fantasy, a little bit more about the world in general. :) The world of Dreamblood series is fictional but is based on multiple cultures and civilisations that exist (or existed) on African continent: Egyptian, Nubian and Arabian bedouins. The mythology and religion is totally new (at least it was to me) and their magic is powered by dreams. Complete mind-blow, trust me.Another thing where The Shadowed Sun excels is the characters. They were so realistic, so human, so much better in details than inThe Killing Moon (Dreamblood). I could feel their emotional turmoil as it was my own, I was reading devouring pages hoping to see that they will get a little bit happiness in the end. If you would make me pick my favorite I really could not decide.On one side, we have Hanani - first woman that was permitted to become a healer in the service of their Goddess. We follow her as she struggles with doubts that she is ""not strong enough to serve her"" and with resistance in her colleagues and patients. Every girl who had to work in primary-male profession can surely identify with Hanani. Although with her stammering and hesitation, Hanani looks shy at first glance, she has a core of stone that will help her to endure a lot of troubles and make all the right decisions on the way.Girl-power heroine - what can be better, right? Well, come and meet Wanahomen. It's not easy to be a son of a King, especially if your father made a lot of wrong decisions. It's not easy admitting your father's mistakes, but Wanahomen must do that before he can move on and cooperate with allies to ""begin the long arduous process of repairing a damaged nation"". Wanahomen has spent last ten years living with N.K. Jemisin's bedouins and we have through him great comparison of this warrior desert culture via Gujaareh's peace-oriented luxurious civilization. And there is very good love story, so if you need a little bit of romance in your novels, Wanahomen got you covered. ;)Both books in Dreamblood series are pretty stand-alone-ish - they don't have cliffhanger endings and can be read out of order, but I still recommend that you read them how the writer intended, because The Shadowed Sun starts with assumption that you are familiar with the religion and customs of Gujaareh and does not explain them in details. And both books are frankly very good and deserve to be read.Sorry if my review is not very helpful I am still riding that just-read-awesome-book high. :) So to sum it up:The Killing Moon (Dreamblood)- good; The Shadowed Sun - even better. You fantasy lovers that are looking for something original and whining how all fantasy books are the same - read this, you will not be disappointed.I recommend this book to fans of: adult fantasy; african inspired culture and setting; original dream-powered magic system; realistic and good characterisation; strong heroines; fierce and stubborn heroes; ...";03 29, 2013;A2SQGR3ID6CZ99;Bookworm Dreams;Very original epic fantasy with African setting;1364515200

;B0077CUOMS;[1, 1];3.0;I love the idea of this app and it is very detailed regarding rank advancements and merit badges, but it needs more functionality. It would be great to cross reference requirements so you could work on advancements and merit badges at the same time. The ability to add dates, notes and photos to the app would be great to have as a reference as well. It also needs to keep a version history to show changes and updates the user makes to his advancement profile.For the price good, and if the developer puts more into this I would pay for a version 2.;01 6, 2014;A22RB5LO8EN87H;"Jim ""Read2More""";Needs more work;1388966400

Gerber 30-000587 Crucial Multi-Tool, Black;B00783N8MO;[0, 0];4.0;It's something small but it makes a huge difference, the fact that all the tools lock into place is awesome.  With my old no-name brand multi-tools everytime I would twist the screwdriver it would close and it drove me nuts!  So it's great these all lock into place, knife came out sharp, and I like everything snaps into place and fits great in my hand.  The only down side is that the pliars don't have a spring, so it takes some getting use to, it probably works better if you have bigger hands and isn't a problem.  I've run into that problem with a lot of stuff, lots of tools don't come in mind for womens smaller hands.

I always wondered what Gord did to make songs sound different even though it's hard to see any differences in his strumming.

Again, punching out eigth notes. Being able to separate Mike and Terry's parts - priceless! This song just picks up momentum - Mike and Terry doubling on the lead... Gord gets into the vocals afterwards in a way uncommon anywhere but at Massey. Rick is totally on cue as well.""Let it Ride"" is almost farcical - Lightfoot loses the words at some point later on in the tune, you can hear that he, and the band, are smiling and laughing but yet nailing the notes.If you've ever wondered how Gord's music is put together, give this a listen.

Coby CSMP95 Super-Slim Soundbar with Wireless Subwoofer, Black;B007BGGPAU;[7, 9];3.0;"I bought this sound bar for our bedroom TV. The sound quality is decent for a product in this price class. However, don't expect any sound close to a Bose system :)  it is too bad that this device doesn't have any digital connections. RC is the only option offered.This system works well enough to enhance the sound of my bedroom TV; however I would not buy it as my main system in the living room.The included remote control is a minor disaster. If it is not held in an exact angle to the receiver in the bar, it will simply not work. This is disappointing and annoying. I had a cheap RCA system in my bedroom before, which unfortunately fell victim to a lightning during a bad thunderstorm a couple of months ago. I had bought this RCA system a couple of years ago for half the price of the Coby soundbar and until its demise I never had problems with the remote control of this ""cheapy.""The big advantage of the Coby sound bar is the wireless subwoofer. The fact that no wiring is necessary was the decisive point for me to buy this system. It lets me enjoy decent sound without having to wire up my bedroom.If the manufacturer would improve the remote control function he would certainly add value to this product.Because of the mentioned limitations the Coby soundbar is a neat little system for a kid's room, bedroom, or guest room. However, it is far away from being able to measure up with ""Big League"" devices manufactured by Panasonic, Sony and their competitors. Bose doesn't even have to be mentioned in the same breath as this little toy.Overall I am not disappointed with the purchase of this product. ""You get what you pay for"" is one of my strong believes and I did get what I expected and not more.The reason I decided to give a 3-star rating only is the really inferior quality of the soundbar's remote control.";09 28, 2012;A3SVKE4IJAEEOF;"Martina Kilgo ""bookworm""";Not bad for the price except for remote control;1348790400

Suddenly, I discover that while getting myselfcofortablein my lazyboyrecliner, headphones on and I-Pad fired up, this Symphony is already half overand I'm on track 3 of 3, with the chorus now engaged.  Naturally, I'll play this very short 20th Century symphony again, since Petrenkotakes only 18:28 to traverse this odd and striking opus 14.  The symphony has 3 movements, an opening largo(5:40), an allegro molto (6;51) AND A CONCLUDING CHORUS ENTITLED&#34;TO OCTOBER.&#34;  The ending does not have any tempo markings but is in the Allegro/andante region.  The choral text is by Alexander Bezimensky a contemporary of the composer,born in 1898.  it's short duration is anarrtive of the Russin people's struggle for freedomfrom the zarist gripand their march intothe &#34;light of Leninist Russia.  Propoganda, big time, it waas written by the young and stillvery naive artist who woul, before he left this world, become one of the most powrful and eloquent anti-Soviet voices of the last 125 yearsTHE MUSIC BEGINS IN PIANISSIMO,ITH TREDING BASSES AND &#34;DISTANT&#34;MIDDLEAND UPPER STRINGS, IN A WHIRLINGSET OFFIGURES AND MOODS, COLORED BY THE AMBIGUOUSGREYNESS OFTHE OPPRESIVE SOCIETY INTO WHICH THIS GREAT MUSICIAN WASBORN.

Some have labeled this music the sound of chaos and dis-order, society in the last months of imperial subjugationand bdefore the dawn of Socialist deliverance.

;B007D00BHC;[0, 0];4.0;"4 starsThis was a very good story. I liked both Brisa and Darius. Their story was short but well written and interesting with lots of hot sex. This is the first story I've read by this author but based on this I'll probably read more of her work in the future.Brisa is a nice woman that works as a bartender. She's noticed a man that's been coming in her bar for a while and she's attracted to him but he never approaches her. With some encouragement from a friend Brisa approaches him and the attraction spikes. When he offers to walk her to her car after work she wonders just where this will lead.Darius is a warrior of Anubis. He was originally part of the 5th crusade in the 1200s but was mortally injured while in Egypt and he ended up agreeing to serve Anubis in return for immortality. As his service to Anubis, Darius senses evil doers that are near, shifting to a half-jackal form and sending them to Anubis in the underworld. Darius has spent the last (almost) 800 years sending evil doers to the underworld to be judged for their crimes but in all that time he's never been interested in more than a one night stand with a woman...until Brisa.Darius can't stay away from Brisa's bar but he's convinced he can't have a relationship with her because of what he is. When she approaches him in the bar he can't keep from asking for more time with her. He arranges to walk her to her car after her shift ends and then asks her to go out with him the next day. Brisa is very interested in seeing more of Darius so she's all for them going out the next day. When Darius calls her as promised they get together and end up back at his place. Things get a bit hot and heavy between them but Brisa unexpectedly being called in to work halts things before they go too far. Darius asks her to spend more time with him and since she has the next few days off (after her shift that night) he asks her to come stay with him on her days off. She agrees and Darius makes arrangements to meet her at work that night when her shift ends. Unfortunately, Darius runs in to some trouble with a demon that's trying to kill him. The demon spells him so Darius is forced to shift in to his half-jackal form and he can't shift back. This causes Darius in to a situation where he has to stand Brisa up and neither one of them are happy about it.Darius is able to shift back to human the next morning so he calls Brisa and apologizes. Brisa isn't the type of woman that puts up with a man standing her up but she likes Darius a lot (and is already falling for him) so she accepts his excuse this time but makes it clear that behavior isn't acceptable with her. Darius picks her up and they hang out together, having lots of sex and doing a few other things. During this time the feelings between Darius and Brisa escalate very fast and soon Darius finds out that she's his mate (hence the insta-love) and if she accepts his bite she can share his life force and be immortal like him. Darius isn't sure Brisa will be accepting of him when he tells her who he is so he holds off at first and its rather unfortunate because when the demon shows back up, Brisa is there and sees Darius shift. She's freaked by his shifting but the demon scares her more and she can see that Darius tries to protect her. The demon isn't vanquished but they manage to get rid of him temporarily, which is good because Darius gets injured during the fight and Brisa does her best to help him. There's some drama that goes on as Darius recovers and they have &#34;the talk&#34; but it turns out well. Brisa agrees to become Darius' mate and they take out the demon so they're free to start their HEA together.This was a very enjoyable story. I liked both Brisa and Darius and was happy things worked out for them. It's a short story (only taking place over a couple of days) but with it being a PNR, the insta-love factor works in the story. I'll probably try the next book in the series in the future. I'd recommend this book. :)";04 12, 2014;A10DX94ATZQEFG;"Malinda ""I love books and love to get lost in...";Very good start to the series :D;1397260800

OBi202 VoIP Phone Adapter with Router, 2-Phone Ports, T.38 Fax;B007D930YO;[2, 2];5.0;"*****IMPORTANT CHANGES TO GV SERVICE THAT GREATLY AFFECT THE OBIHAI ********Now that google has announced that they are discontinuing the ability for devices like the obihai (or the IPGroove app for that manner) interacting with Google Voice on May 15th 2014, it will take a bit of a workaround to get things working correctly.If you still want free INCOMING service you can sign up for a free upstate new york number with Callcentric or a washington state number with IPkall (note even though it is upstate new york or washington state you can just have your GV number forward to it). Outgoing calls will cost money unless you use the online dialer/hangouts method of having google call you and then call your caller (which is always an option). Another is to just pay call centric a penny or so per call by calling your google voice number, entering the phone number you wish to dial and then having google voice call you back (making it an incoming call). That should work if google does not get rid of this feature. To make it easier you can even enter your GV number in speed dial hit *74 + 1+YOURGVNUMBER and a 2-9 (to select one of the 8 speed dial slots). Then you can just hit the speed dial number you chose (say 2) followed by the pound sign and you will automatically dial your GV number. Once you call your GV number (assuming you have it set up correctly) you can then enter the number you wish to call, hang up, answer when google voice rings you, and everything will be set. Like I said a bit of a pain but not awful either and still works well in a multi-person household (you just each need a callcentric number and a GV speed dial number).Note this was my first review which was before the new news:I previously had am ooma but sold it for 50 bucks and used the money to buy this Obihai device. While it does cost 12-15 dollars a year for e911 service (something I would recommend buying) this is less than paying the regulatory fees on my old ooma. Compared to the Ooma this device is superior as it allows up to 4 phone numbers (or 3 and 1 e911 service number) without any additional fees. The ooma however is more user friendly. Anyways I got it primarily as I didn't want to pay ooma a hundred bucks a year for a second phone number and I was tired of accidentally answering my wife's phone calls. With this device we now have separate ring tones for our google voice numbers and eventually I may upgrade our home phones to two-line versions (which the 202 allows as it has two phone jacks). While it comes by default with line 1 as a ""normal"" ring and line 2 as a ""double"" changing the rings to sometheing else is quite complex (google it, you have to go into ""advance settings"" and it isn't intuitive at all), but it works. Additionally you can dial **1 **2 etc. to make phone calls originate from whichever google voice (or other provider) number you desire, again a useful feature in a multi-person household if you don't own multi-line phones.In terms of e911, Obihai struck a deal with anveo for either 12 or 15 dollars a year. This will take up one of the four phone call slots, limiting you to 3 google voice (or other provider's) numbers. iThe difference between the 12 and 15 dollar a year plan is that the 15 will also send emails/texts to whatever addresses (up to four) you specify whenever an 911 call is placed. This is useful if you have children/want to me notified if someone calls 911 from your house and is a $3 a year premium over the basic service. Even if you don't think you need e911 service it is good  to have just in case anything ever happens.";10 24, 2013;A28RNCMMYEZYM0;David G. Huss;****See changes concerning Google Voice*****;1382572800
OBi202 VoIP Phone Adapter with Router, 2-Phone Ports, T.38 Fax;B007D930YO;[4, 5];5.0;I have had the OBI 202 now for about a year. I use one device to handle both my home phone and business numbers. I won't bore you with the details of my setup, but suffice it to say that I receive my business calls both on my cell phone and cordless phones in the house using Google Voice. I can also call out easily from both numbers using my home phones, which saves me from ever worrying about going over on my cell phone minutes.Early on I had a few problems with the OBI device where it wouldn't make outgoing calls. I had to reset the device, and I also had to login to the OBI website and disable and reenable my GV numbers. I was worried it was going to be an ongoing problem, but it has been several months now and I haven't had any more issues.What's great:I use the OBI feature in which my mother (who lives in San Diego while I live in Denver) uses my device to make long distance calls. She calls a local San Diego number, which I set up as another GV account linked to my OBI device, and my OBI asks her whether she wants to call through to me or dial another number. Because of this she no longer has to use a paid service to make long distance calls. She can call anyone in the US and can keep in touch for free with her family in Canada.Another feature I use frequently is outgoing fax. This has always been a problem with previous VOIP services, but it is completely flawless with the OBI 202. This alone makes the device worth the cost. I think you can probably set up incoming fax as well but that hasn't been necessary in my situation. With the OBI 202 you could easily have a second GV number that you used as a designated fax line with no additional monthly cost.Seriously, I can't figure out why everyone doesn't do this. I have had VOIP services for at least 10 years. I used Teleblend for most of that time and was perfectly happy with them. But for as long as GV is free, this saves me over $100 a year, and it works perfectly.I recommend this product without reservation.;12 8, 2012;A1PGCXTM5MNIMJ;"Heather Smith ""household appliance aficionado""";Why does anyone still pay for phone service?;1354924800

To those who do not know, most other aloe plants are poisonous, not for consumption, so anything labeled as edible and aloe is generally aloe very which has many medicinal purposes, my mom used to have a jar of pure aloe vera juice in the fridge to drink, needless to say, I was not a fan.I will say this does actually have a very crisp taste, it is not slimy as some other aloe vera drinks I have had before.  I am big on texture and I hate anything slimy, so texture-wise this drink is a win for me, but while the flavor is good, it's not good enough for me to merit spending the money on it.It's not overly sweet, just enough, and it is very drinkable when cold, but not so much when warm.  If you don't mind the taste of Aloe Vera, unlike me, then you'll like it.  I think you're better off just growing your own plant (they grow very fast) and scraping out the pulp of the leaves and putting it in a smoothie or something if you want its health benefits, much cheaper, and its fresh so you'll get all the nutrients and such.God Bless ~Amy;02 6, 2013;A2RHV42BTJSVON;"Liolania ""In2Jesus""";Not too Bad;1360108800

;B007GTWKSI;[0, 0];4.0;Dark Mercy was an incredibly engaging story with a noble sexy priest, and an evil bitchy vampire. Even though this was only76 pages long it was so full of events and details that it didn't really read like a novella.Father Hadrian is the priest that Angeline has decided to turn into her mate. There's a sense of darkness to Hadrian that Angeline finds intriguing. She has been alone for years and when she meets Hadrian she feels a kinship towards him. This story was heavy with Catholicism which added rich details to the characters' story line. There's a brilliant cliff-hanger ending that was cruel for the character as well as the reader. I enjoyed the twists that occurred in Dark Mercy and am looking forward to reading the rest of Hadrian and Angeline's story.;03 10, 2012;A3V1JX96N9J54S;AsianCocoa;Great paranormal novella;1331337600

Other reviewers commented on the abruptness of the book, but I think it was great when you consider the length of the book.  Looking forward to reading some of her full-length novels because her writing style was easy to read and enjoyable.  If the kids are down for a nap or you have an hour lunch break, read this.  It's a cute storyline about going home again and rekindling a romance with that one guy who you crushed on all throughout high school but never dated.

It arrived very promptly and I loved the yellow watch box.  It is a little bit more heavy than I thought, but it was ready to go and I put it on and the fit with the ajustable band is great.  I have been getting many compliments on it and even the orange band color.  One person said it looks very expensive.  It also keeps great time.

Invicta Women's 12131 Angel Beige with Bird Image Dial Orange Leather Watch;B007HN8GK4;[1, 1];5.0;This is a very nice women's watch, but it's definitely not worth the $2000 MSRP as listed here on Amazon.  I bought it as a special deal from my Windows Phone's Amazon app (although I didn't see it on Amazon.com website at the time), so I ended up paying less than the cheapest price Bing Shopping could find.  (Unlike Google shopping, Bing Shopping does not discriminate against sellers who don't advertise with them and includes all legit sellers in its results.)  I bought it as a gift and the recipient thought I'd paid $500 for it.  Of course, once she searched for it on bing she laughed, too, but she still doesn't know I paid even less than the lowest price on Bing!Ok, pricing aside, this is a high-quality watch. It's bigger than I thought. When I first looked at the product image in the Amazon app for windows phone, I thought the watch was going to be small, but its face is actually quite big for a women's watch. (A quick search on watch quality on Bing revealed that the SMALLER a lady's watch is, the pricier it is, ceteris paribus.)  My recipient is average in height and weight but the watch fits her wrist just fine. Any thinner and she wouldn't be able to wear this without looking stupid.  So if you're a lady below average in height or weight, you probably want to stay away from this watch.;05 16, 2013;A5JLAU2ARJ0BO;"Gadgester ""No Time, No Money""";Nice watch, despite the crazy MSRP;1368662400

New Trent CarbonPak 12000mAh Portable Dual USB Port External Battery Charger/Power Pack for Smartphones, Tablets and more (Upgraded Version of IMP100P);B007IMPTNQ;[0, 0];5.0;This is a good and reliable power pack that is stylish and performs well.  The pack arrived nearly fully charged, and only required about 90 minutes of additional charging to bring it up to full speed.  The 4 LED's give you a clear indication of your charging status at every step of the way.  The power pack is hefty, yet unobtrusive, and can still fit in most pockets, especially coat pockets.  It comes complete with a cable to connect to your PC, and this cable will charge your power pack through a standard USB connection nicely.  The case is made of a heavy durable plastic and while I haven't used it a long time yet, it seems fairly scratch resistant to standard rough surfaces and other mild abrasions.  I have used it on two trips so far, one local, and one long distance, and found the power pack a lifesaver whether you are stuck in traffic with a dying phone battery, or in a hotel without power due to nearby storms and flooding.  Overall valuefor the price paid is very good, and heavy road warriors might want to consider buying two of these.One area of improvement seems to be the documentation, which is very minimalist.  The very first diagram you will see in your owners manual is an A/C wall charger - yet no such charger is provided, and though the assumption here is you already have a wall charger from your phone that you can use, it is still conspicuous by it's absence and the average consumer is still going to be looking for it.  The power pack has a button on it, but nowhere in the documentation does it say what this button is for or when it should be pushed.  Again, for most people this is intuitively the power button, but again, the lack of explanation of what this button is for is conspicuous by its absence.;10 14, 2013;A2RE975V0OTQ0O;"Telemacchus ""Telemacchus""";NT120C CarbonPak External Battery Pack;1381708800

;B007IPPQDG;[0, 0];3.0;This case fits great on the vita, but is made of a very cheap plastic. Also, if you are using the official Sony screen protector (only covers the screen and not whole face) this case will cause the edges to bubble out and not stick to the screen. This is due to the case applying pressure and I doubt it would be an issue with a screen protector like Hori's that covers the whole face.The case snaps together and is easy to put on, but a chore to take off. I had to apply some serious force to pry the two pieces apart. Once it's on though, you shouldn't need to take it off. The game slot, and charging port are all easily accessible with the case on. Overall, I would recommend this if you don't mind a really low quality material.;06 27, 2013;A36ERBBYLWZVYD;Joshua J.;Okay, but not very high quality.;1372291200

;B007IYF3Z8;[2, 3];4.0;First, this was a useful resource for me (I passed the exam today). It provided a helpful check of my knowledge and helped me identify a few areas where I needed a bit more study.  I found it quite convenient to flip through these sample questions using the Kindle App on my Android Phone, while riding the bus and train.My first complaint is that most of the questions were too easy. Yes, most of the questions on the actual test seemed pretty easy, but not quite as easy as these questions. Too many of the questions lacked relevant distractor answers (wrong answers that demand thought before exclusion).My other complaint is that although the formatting worked for most questions in the first half or 2/3 of the book were formatted so that you could read the question and available multiple-choice options, but had to flip to the next page to read the correct answer, this changed in the last sections of the ebook, for both sample questions and flash cards -- answers appeared right in sequence with no page-break.I found this useful, and if the same author/publishers offers a similar product for the Security+ exam, I would probably buy it. For me, that's enough to award the book four stars, despite the issues mentioned above.;04 26, 2013;A1HU5NWYNYLYW8;Mark J. Welch;Too Easy, With Formatting Problems;1366934400
Aeon Labs Aeotec Z-Wave Minimote Remote Control, White;B007J26PIS;[0, 0];5.0;"I have a Simon XTI alarm system which is monitored by Livewatch.com and automated by Alarm.com (Livewatch uses Alarm.com's interface to provide some automation and mobile app features).  I made a bad assumption that the Simon XTI's z-wave functionality (which I am told by Livewatch that the z-wave portion of the Simon XTI is actually an Alarm.com module installed on the Simon XTI, not part of the Simon XTI itself) would be able to &#34;Associate&#34; 3-way light switches....BAD assumption.  Using z-wave light switches, particularly in the case of Evolve light switches, requires that those z-wave switches are &#34;Associated&#34; with each other so that they can communicate with each other and the Z-wave controller recognizes them properly.  Because the Simon XTI / Alarm.com system cannot perform this Associate function, I had &#34;slave&#34; light switches that were inoperable because I had no way to pair them with the master light switch.  Aeon Minimote to the rescue.  By adding all light switches to my Z-wave network (with the Simon / Alarm.com system) AND adding this Aeon Minimote to the same z-wave network, I followed the simple procedure to use the Minimote to &#34;Associate&#34; the evolve light switches with each other where they are on the same 3-way circuit.  While I am irritated to have to find this solution (boo Simon XTI / Alarm.com), I was incredibly pleased with the Aeon Minimote!";06 16, 2014;A2O6KPOQB4ID03;Buyer XYZ;Savior for 3-way switches on Alarm.com / Simon XTI alarm system automation;1402876800

U By Kotex Sleek Tampons Super Absorbency,18 Count (Pack of 8);B007JL4HHA;[0, 0];4.0;"I've already tried this exact same line of tampon by Kotex, except the ""regular"" size, and they were fine.  These are much the same in design.  The packaging is very easy to open due to the pre-scored rip-off point.  Of course, this one has a plastic applicator, which is MUCH superior to the crappy cardboard ones.  This slides in easily and doesn't collapse, which is nice but is a general benefit of plastic applicators.  This tampon does set itself apart a bit by having a nice easy to grip non-slip rubberized handle, which is a very nice feature.  I do have one complaint, and that's that for being a ""super"" size, they are very small.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say they are only marginally bigger than the ""regulars"".  I'd much prefer my ""super"" to actually be the size I'd expect from other brands.

;B007JVM69Q;[1, 1];5.0;"What more do you want? Probably more will be the answer after viewing these wonderful, timeless shows from The Dean Martin Show, certainly one of the best, if not the best, variety show from the classic years of the 1960's and '70's. There are 6 ""uncut"" episodes, spanning the years 1966 to 1971, and all of them have enough special moments, great singing, and comic gems to make this purchase a MUST for Martin fans. ALL of the guests listed are here, so I was bemused from some of the negative comments. The picture and sound quality is VERY GOOD to EXCELLENT throughout. The ENTIRE shows are here and there are even the commercial breaks with Dean's picture and the announcer stating, ""and tonight's sponsor is ..."" and you get to hear the music playing without the commercials. Wonderful. You will be transported back to an era when TALENT mattered - real talent. There are moments when Dean is clearly clowning through a song, but others when he is fully engaged - and the performances are often moving. Most of the comic bits hold up well, especially when it's clear that Dean, perhaps underrehearsed, is having a grand time ""improvising"" through a scene, which keeps the comedy fresh and appealing all these years later. ""The Dean Martin Show"" began in 1965, barely 10 years after his split from Jerry Lewis, but you can see Dean actually doing some ""Jerry"" in his comic routines. The guests range from Sid Caesar, to Bob Newhart, to Joey Heatherton, and all of it is remarkably ""modern."" You get a show from his very first season and the DVD's end with a show from 1971, one of the last real seasons of the show before the show became almost weekly ""roasts"" of other celebrities. For the price you are paying, which is rather low, 6 uncut episodes of this incredibly entertaining show are worth the price and you can just hope that others will follow. The best part of the show, for me, is still when Dean jumps up on the piano, with Ken Lane playing, and proceeds to spend a few minutes making fun of classic songs, with different, funny lyrics, and then sits on the couch and proceeds to craft a song with his impeccable phrasing and tone. He was a gifted singer, terrific straight man and comedian and actor, and a legend. No one even remotely like him today. No one quite this fun. And how we miss his great talent. You can experience it again here and it's well worth it. FIVE STARS!";01 15, 2013;A3NI800P6Q6YNS;Matthew J. Gallagher;Dean Martin, Timeless Singing, Great Clowning, Terrific Shows;1358208000

Flash Furniture Coylin Cocktail Table;B007L7JCJU;[0, 0];5.0;I have a living room with lots of tufted furniture so I wanted a bit of a contemporary coffee table so that my living room didn't look too feminine while looking feminine.

Betsey Johnson Women's Cuddly Back Satin Pajama Set, Lace Cadet Blueberry Hill, Medium;B007LNP6UI;[0, 0];5.0;This set was bought as a Christmas gift for my mother who is almost 89 years old.

Serial LCD Module 20x4 Blue with White Backlight for Arduino;B007LOORZW;[0, 0];5.0;This character LCD is a nice display for what you pay, just keep in mind you are ordering a component and not a finished retail product. As the other reviewer mentioned, if you have worked with serial LCD's or even parallel LCD's you can have this one running in minutes. While it has a slightly different command set than the Sparkfun serial LCD's, these use the same command set as New Haven Displays, of which there are many classes out there for the various micro controllers.The nice thing about this particular LCD is that while it comes as a serial driven display, on the back of the board there are two jumper pads you can solder to set the display to use either I2C or SPI. I uploaded an image to the gallery which notes the area of the jumpers. Having this flexibility built in (with no daughter boards nonetheless) makes this LCD suited for many projects.I have one gripe with the display and that is when a character is blinking, the character directly below it also blinks with it a bit. Other than that I have been pleasantly surprised with just how fast it draws full text, even with the default baud rate of 9600bps.;05 4, 2012;A2FTHT3VAIJ8UJ;David;Flexible display for the money;1336089600

;B007M0M8EW;[0, 0];5.0;"Prohibition, bathtub gin, bootleggers, model T's, jazz and the talkies - all part of the rip-roaring 1920's and all part of Californian writer, Jeffrey Stone's debut mystery, Play Him Again. Jeffrey Stone, a self confessed research addict has written an intriguing mystery interspersed with fascinating facts about the beginning of the Hollywood `talkies' movie industry which includes brief interludes from the real lives of silent movie actors and studio bosses.It's 1928 in downtown Venice, California and things are not looking good for con man Danny Kincaid. Savagely beaten, a bottle of whiskey was poured down his throat before he was wedged behind the wheel of his Essex Super Six Coupe. Two very bad guys push the coupe off the end of Sunset Pier and, unable to open a window or door, Danny takes a one way trip to the Pacific Ocean floor.Danny's body and car recovered next morning by the cops, they figure: Danny, drunk as a skunk, accidentally drove off the end of the pier. Not so, says Danny's best friend, Matt Hudson (Hud). Hud, a swell guy, is a major player in the liquor industry - he's a rumrunner/bootlegger with an impressive list of movie star and club owner clients. The 1919 Volstead Act introduced prohibition of transporting and selling of intoxicating beverages in the US. Drinking alcohol though, wasn't illegal and half the population regarded bootleggers like Hud, not as criminals but as legitimate businessmen.Hud, sure Danny was murdered, vows to avenge his death.  But first he has to find out the con Danny was working on, and most importantly: who was being conned.A 1920's buff, I found Play Him Again's opening chapters on Hud's and other bootlegger's operations riveting and amazing. Did patrons of illegal speakeasys know how the bottles of gin, whiskey etc they swallowed got to their table? Bootlegging was a violent, dangerous profession, many men were killed; Gangsters, tommy guns the preferred weapon, attacked and sank supply boats and delivery trucks were regularly hijacked. Maybe, 1920's consumers weren't aware that the liquor speakeasys sold was often thinned with embalming fluid and iodine to give it a kick or maybe they didn't care - either way it must have been like swallowing paint stripper.Hud's supply boat and delivery trucks are hijacked by Frank Minetti's gang and he discovers Minetti's the guy who ordered Danny's execution.  Minetti was Danny's last mark; he conned him out of thousands of dollars by using Movietone early sound recording equipment to make a bogus talkie. Minetti agreed to invest and handed over the dough but unfortunately for Danny, he got tipped off it was a con and when the lights went down so did Danny.Hud felt responsible - many times he had discussed with Danny his dream to leave bootlegging behind and make talkies. Maybe Danny would still be alive if Hud hadn't given him the idea for the con. Absorbing factual data has been woven through the story about early sound recording systems and the problems studios faced in introducing sound to a public hooked on silent films/stars - really interesting.Sylvia, Hud's gorgeous upper class girlfriend, begs him to leave it to the cops to catch Minetti but a guy's gotta do what a guy has to do. Together with his second-in-command, Swede, Hud works out a plan to make sure Minetti gets what he deserves - you'll have to read Play Him Again to find out what that is.Whether you're a twenties fan or not, Play Him Again is a good read. Exciting and suspenseful, my only quibble was: a bit of the dialogue could, like bootleg liquor, have been cut to ensure the plot kept percolating. Practice makes perfect, and I'm sure Jeffrey Stone's next Matt Hudson mystery will be even better than the first. I'm looking forward to it.";05 20, 2012;A3VVP6QYRUIS8G;bookbuzz;Lots of Fun;1337472000

;B007MSVKD4;[13, 13];5.0;"I've been a reader of the regular magazine issues ofOutdoor Photographer, but from a small note that I had seen on the Facebook page for Outdoor Photographer Magazine, decided to take a look and see if was available as a Kindle edition, and was pleasantly pleased to find it here. But from past experience, some of the online editions that one finds here can be not only annoying in their formatting, but quite substandard, to put it mildly.Luckily for us, this digital edition of Outdoor Photographer doesn't suffer from some of these problems.Outdoor Photography Magazine isn't just about great outdoor photos, but there are enough of them to satisfy, that's for sure. Just taking the recent July 2012 issue, you find Scott Mansfield's b&w; image of ""Yosemite Valley and Clouds"" along with his ""Muir Woods"" and Jon Cornforth's large full-color capture ""Denali Sheep"" shows up quite well here. There are many more to be found, in both b&w; and in full color, and in most cases the photographers list the gear that they used along with good commentary.Rob Sheppard's how-to article ""Organization Will Set You Free!"" offers excellent basic organization techniques to help you find, sort and catalog your images on your computer, which has been a challenge for many, and his photos and images help illustrate this, with ideas that work with Adobe Photoshop Elements Organizer, Adobe Bridge, Apple Aperture and a variety of dedicated filing programs.You'll find equipment sections along with product reviews, and the columns that we're used to in the printed-paper editions are here, along with the editorials. There are features and helpful how-to articles throughout.It should be noted that this digital publication is not set up for the legacy Kindle devices; as noted in the little drop-down on the product page, this one is only available for the Kindle Fire and the Kindle for iPad (Version 2.9 or later) as of this date. For those who are looking for other monthly digital photo editions that work well with the Kindle Fire, check outShutterbug, as it's proven to be a good one.One thing worthy of note: if you find the heavy use of ads to be a distraction, look for the Menu icon on the bottom middle of the Kindle Fire's screen. By tapping on this icon, you'll see the choice between Page View (the default) and Text View. Tapping on Text View allows you to read all of the articles without the proliferation of advertising... yet all of the photos are still there, and in glorious color when they appear in the magazine that way. Just imagine if you had an editorial assistant who took scissors to the advertisements and just cut them all out, leaving you with all of the text and images.Bottom line is that this Kindle edition ofOutdoor Photographeris easily worth a 5-star recommendation, and this is one with which you can enjoy all of the photos, editorials, how-to articles and product reviews the way you like. And don't forget that a subscription to the Kindle Fire edition of Outdoor Photographer comes with a 14-day free trial, so you have a chance to review it and see. Try it and you'll see what I mean.7/31/2012";07 31, 2012;AEJAGHLC675A7;John Williamson;Outdoor Photographer: Excellent on the Kindle Fire;1343692800

;B007MV0HBM;[0, 0];5.0;The SHIVA Compression is as good as it gets in the category of infectious fiction...books and series by Lee Child, John Grisham, Nelson DeMille, and the late John D. MacDonald come to mind. It does everything these well-known authors do--can't put the book down, lasts an entire plane flight, grab it over lunch, stay up late, put things off and read instead, plays on your mind at times in between being able to read it. One key is getting hooked on the main character, in this case Perry Helion, more fallible and human than some superheroes, a guy you cheer for all the harder. Where Tim Queeney really excels is creating a richly textured fabric and context for the story to unfold with his extensive knowledge of technical detail, and his skill at effortlessly weaving it through the plot, making it thoroughly believable and compelling. The book has a movie-like quality, and as the action builds one begins visualizing the vividly depicted scenes. This is a great escape, a great read, by a truly talented writer...and it says at the end that the next Perry Helion thriller is on the way (The Atlas Fracture). Can't wait...;07 5, 2012;A2S4EBFHFZQ531;Scott;As good as it gets;1341446400

I would go out and check it, and yes, its hot in there but nothing compared to what it was outside so even though it seems like flimsy material it is insulated enough to protect from extreme heat.  I stayed in it for awhile and it was hot but not uncomfortable - compared to outside.  Right now it is being used to house wet and dry cat food for the 4 strays I have so the flies won't get to it.

Bolle Diablo Sunglasses;B007OXQULE;[0, 0];5.0;"I have owned several high-end sunglasses, including Oakley M Frames and most recently Bolle Piranha. I highly recommend the Bolle Diablo polarized sunglasses. The frame is lightweight and barely noticeable. The nose-clip is comfortable and adjustable. The aluminum vents and anti-fog lenses do just that, prevent fogging from physical exertion. The lens are very scratch resistant and extremely clear. They are clearer than my Piranha's, which lasted a good 4 years before a hinge broke. While the price may scare some away, I think this is a case of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;, and I am very pleased with my pair.";05 30, 2014;A1Q1X71W1C9KKR;G.

SwaddleDesigns Marquisette Swaddling Blanket, Jewel Tone Stripes, Very Berry;B007PDHXD2;[4, 4];5.0;"I give myself credit for being an amazingly smart mom in the ""blanky"" department.  When my first was born, I got two 4packs of identical fabric blankets (the competitor brand to this, Aden &Anais; muslin swaddles).  I washed them in a regular rotation, gave her a new one each day.  She had a serious Linus-like dependency on her blanky (had to take it EVERYWHERE for the first 18-20 months), but thanks to my brilliance, she was content with any of the 8.  I could sleep at night because I wasn't worried about losing the irreplaceable blanky at a restaurant or daycare.I swore by them, gave them to everyone as shower gifts, and was basically a walking advertisement for A&A.;Second kid I did the same thing, but he's a drooler.  So I needed a couple extra to keep from doing laundry more than once a week.  I was bored with the prints A&A; had, and saw these.  I have converted.These are quite a bit bigger, and my #2 is huge, so at 28 1/2 inches long, he's still totally swaddle-able with these.  The fabric is nicer.  It washes better, it's softer--I would actually describe it as silky, even though it's cotton.  I really love the colors/prints, and I like that I don't see every kid on the street with the same thing.And these have the same features I liked about the A&A; muslin swaddles: lightweight, never too hot, breathable, absorbent for drool/spit-up/leaky milk, work great as a nursing cover, big enough and breathable enough to be an excellent stroller cover/sun shade, and since it's so big you can wad it up on top of the baby to keep him warm if it's chilly outside.  Since it's so thin, you can fold it tiny enough to stash in your purse.  My only complaint is that I didn't find these earlier and start with them instead of the Aden & Anais.";11 20, 2012;A2ES3SU8BT1IIA;Lawyermom;Love, love, love;1353369600

Have no doubt, there's some very evil and scary people in this Series. Compared to most zombie novels that are clean cut, this series does not hold back. Definitely not as many happy endings and magical ""saves"" as becomes apparently straight out in Book 1, and continues to follow this path for the remainder of the Series.Ultimately I found it an addicting read.

I haven't had the chance to test them while biking, but I will say that when sitting around the house, the ear-buds didn't fall out (as often happens with my older pair). The sound through them was also excellent and even, at least at the start, a little loud, which was certainly not a problem with my previous pair. I'm also very pleased at having a pause button and volume control on the cables, though the volume control is a bit more binary than I'd like.These also seem to be a very sturdy product.

;B007RGWZVM;[8, 8];4.0;After reading through the Canon Owners Instruction Manual a number of times, I read the Canon 5D Mark III Experience.  It is a very good accompanying book, as it provides a deeper look at most of the functions and features of the camera, and some useful recommendations on how to best set certain functions/features.  The book also discusses photography principles and how to apply them when shooting with the Canon 5D Mark III.  Photographs are used to illustrate how certain features/settings work. I think it is definately worth the money. I would have given it a 5 star rating if it had gone into to more depth on video, but the title clearly states the book is about Still Photography.;04 24, 2012;A3I3DTTBWCMY07;A.

The only BIG problem is that it is NOT meant for the iphone 4 or 4s the way it was advertised. I don't think that the designer realized that the plastic cover on the inside covers the ear part and because of this, the sensor also is blocked, This causes the phone calls to drop and you end up pressing up on all the keys with your cheek while you are talking. This is NO good!. I paid $12 for a product i CANNOT use. Now its just sitting on my desk picking up dust.

"EC TECHNOLOGY&reg; Best Iphone 4 4S Wallet Case, Handmade Genuine Leather Case Cover - Brown";B007SM02Q0;[4, 4];1.0;When I first received this product I was very happy with it. It looks like a little book. The fit was great and all the stitching was snug.Now, I'm a little less satisfied.  The case stitching is holding up but the leather is stretching. This means that it no longer holds my phone securely. I've had to grab my phone out of mid air a couple of times now dues to it sliding out. I wish they had added a latch of some sort to the tab that goes over your phone.  I plan to try a small square of Velcro to see if that helps.Edit: I've had the case 2 months now. The stitching for the license see through portion failed today. I only use that section for my Driver's License and debit card so it's not as if I'm stuffing it with too many cards. I'm very disappointed that this case didn't hold up. It looked good when new, but the low quality materials and stitching made it actually dangerous to use since my phone just falls out of it.TD:DR - Case looked good when new but it's so cheaply made it didn't last two months.;06 13, 2013;AFPZSO7197TJ9;Hey Hey Paula;"Started out great but not so much now.

"EC TECHNOLOGY&reg; Best Iphone 4 4S Wallet Case, Handmade Genuine Leather Case Cover - Brown";B007SM02Q0;[2, 3];4.0;"I really do like this product - and will probably keep using it.  I'm trying to do away with my back-pocket wallet.  But one thing has been frustrating (and maybe someone here has a suggestion).  Something about the leather ""strap"" that holds the top of the phone in the case messes with the iPhone 4S face proximity sensor.  So when I bring the phone up to my face to make or answer a call, I sometimes accidentally enable the mute button with my cheek - which shouldn't happen because of the proximity sensor.  Also, after I bring the phone away from my face, it often doesn't sense this - and keeps the screen black/locked.  Not a deal-breaker - because I don't use my iPhone for calls very much.  But keep this in mind.  Otherwise, the leather is very nice quality - and I get a lot of positive comments on it.  The card slots are a bit tight and make it hard to get the cards out - but I assume that will improve with use.";07 17, 2012;A3IMMOEHXBBH50;Rod Tunnels;Nice Product.

If  you love books like I do, and are feeling a bit nostalgic for actual physical books (I use my Kindle for all of my reading except for academic stuff), this is just right.There are a couple of &#34;buts&#34; to it, though.  It certainly won't replace your wallet, unless you carry no physical money.  It will fit your driver's license, and two credit cards.  If you try to stuff more in there, it will bulge and won't close properly.  To serve as a wallet, it would have to be considerably fatter.  It could also use some kind of closure - a snap, or a magnet or something.  For me these are not a serious issue though.  I'm very satisfied.  I wasn't planning on using it as a wallet anyway, and, aside from looking very cool (in my opinion) it serves the purpose of protecting the screen, which is why I wanted it in the first place (aside from the coolness factor.";01 29, 2013;A2GTU7SOYV5FNV;Tatyana Podgursky;Love it;1359417600

VANGUARD Alta Pro Multi-Angle Tripod 254CB 50;B007SRCZMY;[0, 2];4.0;That was a major disappointment when I realized the 254CB 50 is stellar for still photo shots, but does not adapt for videos or for watching action (sports/racing) events.It is very solid and when set up it is extremely sturdy.

I read and re-read them and then went online to find further information and finally called customer service which was quite helpful.I am not a professional photographer, just someone who loves capturing photos/videos of nature so I would suggest that before purchasing the 254CB 50 you make sure it would be suitable for all your needs.

;B007T36S34;[1, 1];3.0;I bought this for my 7 year old daughter so my review is from that perspective. What sold me on the Kindle were the parental controls and the FreeTime app/service. Parental controls are almost completely absent on the iPad. On the Fire you can determine when the Kindle becomes available to use in the morning and when it shuts down in the evening. You can also specify daily time limits for TV, books and apps. Furthermore there are weekday and weekend settings. You can also set passwords to limit what they can download and to keep them from exiting FreeTime.The FreeTime service is a bargain. There is an impressive amount of content and all the popular kid franchises are there: Dora, Angelina, Curious George, etc. Admittedly, this can be a blessing or a curse. In addition to tabs for books, video and apps there is also a tab for popular characters and themes. This allows you to see all Dora, dinosaur, Curious George content on one page.So far, so good. However, there are a couple of shortcomings that have me knocking off a couple of stars:One of the biggies is that there is no official YouTube app. My kids have multiple playlists of animal, truck, train, etc. videos on my YouTube account. None of them are available on the Fire. You can download some third party YouTube apps but they don't link to your account.FreeTime only works in landscape mode. That's fine for games and watching videos but terrible for reading. Since you have two pages being displayed on the screen the text is quite small, even when you zoom in on it. Also there is no ability to change text size as there is on proper Kindle books. The small text can be a struggle for younger readers.In hindsight, the landscape only mode has me wishing I'd bought the larger screen Fire and I hope the lack of an official YouTube app is fixed in the future. It's still less expensive and has vastly better controls than an iPad and the FreeTime service is worth the reasonable monthly charge.;01 12, 2014;A1RCTU3THEY1AR;"J.

;B007T36S34;[0, 0];5.0;"We bought two of these for our kids (ages 3 and 4) for Christmas.  They loved them from the start, and I had pre- loaded them with a few apps before wrapping them.  When the kids went down for the night my husband and I got to &#34;play&#34; with them.  Now instead of them yelling at each other, I hear &#34;Mommy, Daddy has my Kindle!!!&#34; and &#34;Hold on a minute, let me finish this race and I will give it back!&#34;.  So I think we are going to have order another one for my biggest kid :)Another great feature I love about the Kindle is that I can update both (or all when we get three) of them from any computer via the Amazon App store.  That way I can put educational apps and books on the devices while they are racing each other and they don't even know it.  One of the best apps I put on was Kindle Free Time.  The beautiful thing about the Kindle Free Time is it allows me to set a time limit for &#34;games&#34; and a different time limit for &#34;reading&#34; or &#34;educational apps&#34;. It also allows me to create profiles for each kid and it totally locks away any bank/credit card info from them- so no buying 500 coins to upgrade a race car on MY bank card!!!

;B007T36S34;[0, 0];3.0;"I'd like to say that the new Kindle ire HD is for older kids.. except, the older kids will dislike its lack of a camera. So, maybe it's good for the younger set, as advertised? Maybe, but the FreeTime application turns this kindle into a brick. (Have you seen the NABI commercial?) Toddlers and really young kids will love it -- but they'd be happy with any tablet that plays a game. So what do I do about my passionate reader in 3rd grade who is looking at her brand new device as a source of good reads, but also as an organizer, an ipod and a photo-album in one? She is still too young to be allowed on the internet unchecked, and still needs the guidance that a limited schedule offers. But the schedule is set by the freetime sandbox, which strips music, photo and non-amazon video. For an age-group who is just testing safe limits and their personal voice, the new kindle comes with no camera, no microphone (i.e. no Skype to Grandma or Aunt Ansie), no ability to select the image the device shows to the world when locked, and it uses a parent password to lock the device -- kids this age will want to use a password that *they* know, so that they can protect their device from grabby little brothers. Worse of all, FreeTime disables all organization tasks -- the calendar to begin with.  Outside freeTime, the limited parental control does not include a schedule, and mail / calendar / address book are controlled as a package. A 3rd grader will not be using email for a while, but she certainly is starting to use a phone and an organizer.Still, we love the on-cloud storage. DD accidentally bought several movies that will not even fit on her 16G kindle. (Credit cards were not pin protected by default.) We were able to still access them on my laptop, and have movie night, so at least it was not money thrown away. The tablet is sleek, responsive and very portable. Not only is it a motivational tool for my child, but I, too, have become addicted to the kindle reader format. The Amazon store is adequate for what we need. In fact, it has better math and science apps than the ITune store (maybe the audience for an Android market drives the market deeper in this area). There are sufficient games to last my family, and there's always the possibility to download additional apps from the google Play store or other sources. With Kindle apps supported on multiple devices, we can also share a book and discuss, without having to grab the tablet from each other or pay multiple times for the same content.Ideally, the schedule-setting should exist outside FreeTime, and the Freetime app should allow parents to select pictures and music to be made available in the sandbox. I understand that it is an entry level tablet, but a camera is a must for a tool like this. Support the growing children with simple organization apps built into the out-of-the-box experience, and you get indeed the perfect tablet. As an option, include a safe browser and email / address book with strict parental controls, (parents whitelist contacts the child can email to, and get automatically cc-ed on all communication) as well as a web-accessible activity report, and you get a great children's tablet. BTW, the Funamo app that everyone raves about is incredibly intrusive and joyless. It also disables the &#34;Back&#34; command. Useful, but could be so much better!For an adult use, this tablet is addictive. Absolutely love it. But I bought it for my child, based on reviews and editorials praising freeTme --- which turned out to be a great disappointment, to the point of unusable.One more word about the FreeTime Unlimited subscription -- DON'T. It will ignore all the carefully curated selection of apps, and will flood your child's tablet with random content that Amazon considers appropriate for all kids. It's overwhelming, kids jump from one app to the next, books get neglected and there are no controls. And since it all resides in the cloud, the moment you disconnect from the network, the tablet is still a brick. While initially wowed, my child was relieved when we decided to stop the trial before the full month was over, and return to a situation where she had access  to only individually downloaded apps. Now change that to a model where the contents is available at a monthly rate, but parents still maintain control over downloads, and there is true value in that service.About the device itself, I assume that the new upgrade has a significant boost in speed, but I had the urge to try to trade this tablet with the older model, and get that camera. Nowhere in the marketing literature was it specified that this tablet lacks a camera -- it is a really great disappointment. Of course, the big box I bought this from no longer has the older version in stock, so we're stuck with this model.Amazon, if you need some help developing meaningful age-appropriate parental controls, I'd love to help! There's greatness in this tablet, but I think the product managers were not quite familiar with child development and parenting needs.";01 6, 2014;A1W0WYJGOBU8UW;Kindle Customer;Nice, but mis-matched features;1388966400

It's fast, easy to read, easy to use and I wish I had more money so I could get more books!  The only drawback is that it doesn't support Google Play.  You can get apps to make gmail work, and other things from google, too but you cannot always make the Kindle work for wifi in public places, and it will not accept Scribd due to the the operating system. It's an android, but it has it's very own kind of operating system which only allows Amazon products mostly.  Since there are so many Amazon products this has not proven to be a problem but I do wish they'd let us use it with other stuff besides Kindle Store items.  Otherwise, it's PERFECT!;01 19, 2014;A2QQT7ASL4VMQ7;Morgan reed;ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!;1390089600
;B007T36S34;[8, 11];4.0;It's a good device for the price. I've been using it for less than 24 hours, so this won't be the most thorough review. This is my first Kindle Fire, so I won't be comparing it to the previous generations. I will post an update when I get a better idea of the battery life, but I currently estimate it to last about ten hours. This is based on about three hours of use and how much battery remained. I recommend the 16GB version if you are not planning on getting all or most of your content through Amazon, or if you don't always have access to Wi-Fi for Amazon's Cloud drive. The 8GB version should be fine for people who don't need a lot of storage or who can take advantage of the Amazon Cloud.Pros- I like the design.- Excellent screen for streaming videos or watching videos- Reading is intuitive- I love text-to-speech- No problems with internet dropping. I haven't had any issues with the built in Browser.- Cloud is easy to use- Charged via Micro-USB cable so you probably have about ten compatible chargers lying around your house.Cons- Default music player is kind of annoying, and I haven't found any good alternatives.-Kindle OS is not as user-friendly as Android. No Google Play means you'll be digging hard for alternatives to some of your favorite Android apps or installing them manually.- After my initial setup, I encountered a recurring error where the device would crash when booting up. I had to restore it to factory settings and reinstall the updates. Fortunately, I have had no issues since.;10 4, 2013;A31DHPS7YNIEEK;M.S;Initial recation;1380844800
;B007T36S34;[0, 0];5.0;"I am a casual tablet user whose needs for a Kindle Fire were purely based on convenience and accessibility. That considered, the 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD exceeds any expectations I had and the result is one happy Kindle owner!Meant to replace a decrepit couch side laptop, my Kindle is a stay-at-home device with the purpose of having quick access to sports scores, social media applications, and internet access. To each of these, the Kindle Fire does extremely well and performs with a level of efficiency that I was lacking from the expensive and aging Dell.Installing and managing apps is super simple and accessing them in quick fashion is overtly satisfying. The layout is very streamlined and, most importantly, it makes sense! With a Kindle, there is no need to search aimlessly for what you need - instead, everything resides where it logically belongs and navigating the menus is a breeze.The picture quality is - as you would expect from an HD device - fantastic; the sound is darn good for the size of the speakers; and, the device's response to the touchscreen inputs is spot on.At this level of affordability, it is simply amazing what the Kindle Fire does. For a very long time, this will be my go-to device when sitting at a PC just isn't ideal.

;B007T36S34;[1, 2];1.0;Pages load up very slowly.  Have tried all recommendations to sort this out - looking at bandwidth place etc. and mucking around with my router etc.  The fact is that my iPhone and iPad (at least 3 years old versions) load up pages MUCH faster.  I have to continually turn off wifi on the kindle and then back on again to get a boost to even load up a page.  its like using the internet in 1995.The only thing it's good for is reading a book - but should have just got a paperwhite instead - or in fact, just buy a book.  Very very frustrating.  Do not recommend this - maybe the HDX are better but there seems to be enough forums and comments about the slow speed of the Fire HD to show that it is a common problem.  If i buy a product, i just want it to work immediately out of the box without having to play around with the settings and other hardware - that is why i like apple products so much. They just work.

;B007T36S34;[1, 1];4.0;I ordered the Kindle Fire even though I have one of the original Kindle units and I must admit, I like the original Kindle for reading books better than I like the Kindle Fire HD.  True, the Fire HD provides a clear picture in color but the books are hard to stabilize for reading.  They always seem to be moving on to the next page before you are ready.  Of course, there is the reading rate setting but I find this useless, particularly if you are a person who likes to savor each page as you read.  It puts the reader into a speed reading mode.Probably the feature I miss the most from the original Kindle is the light which informs you that the unit has been completely charged.  The only way to know this on the Kibndle Fire HD is to turn on the unit and look at the display.  Not good,The features I like the best are the ability to play games, particularly Candy Crush and  to get my e-mails without booting up my computer or netbook.  I have yet to try the videos and music features but I am certain these will be helpful when travelling.;11 15, 2013;A15EWCGMRPEVTS;The Psychologist;Trading Up for a Kindle Fire HD;1384473600

;B007T36S34;[0, 0];3.0;"Sorry, I have mixed feelings about the Kindle.  Perhaps it's because my first experience with tablets is with the iPad.  My husband and I have owned iPads for years now and we LOVE them so much.  However, our kids were always taking them from us to play with and we didn't get to use them much anymore.  So for Christmas we decided to buy our son's each a Kindle (couldn't afford to buy them each an iPad or we would have).  It took a little time to get used to the differences with the Kindle and the iPad but in no time we figured it all out.  It's definitely not as user friendly as the iPad.  I find the screen set ups to be confusing.  Anyways, the issue I have with the Kindle is the lower amount of Apps available.  I understand they might be the last to get Apps created for them  but I find that frustrating.  All the games my kids really love are not available on the Kindle yet -- soooo back to taking my iPad they go.  Defeated the whole purpose of buying them their own Kindle.  Also, I deal with ALOT more bugs on the Kindle -- it shuts down frequently for no reason and I am always getting an error when trying to download or purchase in the Apps store.Overall, if I knew it would turn out like this, I would have purchased an Android tablet instead (because I am still not paying $1,000 for iPads for my kids).  But at least the Android tablets get Apps sooner than the Kindle. ;(P.S.  We did the 30-day trial of the &#34;Kindle Free Time&#34; but my kids didn't like it -- they thought the Apps that came preloaded on it were too young for them.  There are a lot of younger preschool type games and books.  I do like that the games do not contain ads for purchases - but you STILL have to pay for most games not already preloaded - I thought ALL games would be free in the App store but it's only the ones that come preloaded.";01 15, 2014;A1NZGPZO6U6D1T;ZumaLun;Sorry, too used to the iPad;1389744000

;B007T8HB3U;[0, 1];5.0;"I never review albums because art shouldn't be critiqued in the casual way it so often is, but this album needs to be reviewed.I've listened to 10 years since ""Into The Half Moon"" and was immediately hooked.  They really found their sound and their style with ""The Autumn Effect"" where they were able to mix their version of heavy rock with a very melancholy force driving the whole thing.  Since then people have been looking to that album as they compare all subsequent albums from 10 years.  Though their music has been good, they have never hit that magic they found in ""The Autumn Effect"", ""Minus The Machine""  crushes it.  They went so far above and beyond what they were able to accomplish in all the other albums because it finally feels like they are just playing for themselves and not for the critics and the label any more.It took me about 3 weeks of listening to this album to finally feel like I've actually absorbed what they are playing.  That is the first sign of a great album, but they also avoid many of the pitfalls of their previous work.  There aren't the songs that get annoying after a few listens and the music carries real power.The main thing that brings the magic here is the pure and unadulterated despair that comes from the forced introspection the music brings, which is a completely impossible task these days.  10 Years has never gotten the recognition they deserve but I know that all the fans as well as myself are very thankful that they continue to put out amazing music, I just don't see how they can top this on their next venture. It seems like a climax that can't surpassed again.  Very refreshing given the type of bubble gum junk pop that perverts the radio these days.";12 3, 2012;A37PV1N8XDOUDG;J.

New Balance Elastic Shoelaces;B007TZBNNC;[10, 10];5.0;I have in the past, used two other types of elastic shoelaces. The first type had hardware that went at the bottom of the laces as well as at the top....a bit of unnecessary complication in my opinion. The second type were the simple curly laces that stay put, just by the nature of the curls that stuck out of the top holes. Those were hard to lace and kept needing the curls stretched out during the lacing process, but were 'ok' after I was done....and the laces did not come out of the holes 'very often'.Enter the Ten Seconds Elastic Laces: I had just gotten a new pair of sneakers that came with the old tie up laces, so off I go to the Amazon website to find some more of the curly stretch laces. I happened to see these, and at first the hardware in the photo turned me off because of my experience with the other ones mentioned above. But the more I looked at the photo and read the description, the more worthy they appeared. So I ordered them. And I am extremely happy with them. They laced up very easily and smoothly, they are WAY easier to adjust, there is plenty of string to keep loose enough for my high instep, and the little hardware clip at the top is nice looking and took only about two seconds to feed strings through & adjust. With my shoes on, the shoestrings feel nice and secure, my shoes do not feel at all like they will slip off, yet there is plenty of give so my feet don't feel constricted.Now that I know how much more I like these over all my other stretchy shoestrings, I am going to go back an get the black, grey, and white. (I got brown the first time). I guess the bottom line, is that for me these laces are perfect!;04 16, 2014;A3RFNCMOL3FSE8;MLouise;Five Star Elastic Laces!;1397606400

;B007UPRPWY;[3, 4];4.0;"A catchy title drew me to this book and I wasn't disappointed.  It's not rocket science in this Florida based novel, but it does have interesting behavioral science of porpoises information, some national defense questions, sometimes shaky family dynamics, and well-drawn characters.  As in the other books in this series, the main characters line up on opposite sides of a court case.  It makes for lively sparring between defense and prosecution strategies, between &#34;playing by the rules&#34; or &#34;winging it&#34;.  The savant son is a key character whose observations and actions are enlightening even as they are aggravating and potentially dangerous. There's a dose of military defense, the FBI, and questions as to who's the real &#34;bad guy&#34; to keep the pages turning!

It has no bronzer in it which is how I can tell it's a fake. You might at well just buy a cheap regular daily lotion at Walmart and use it because I'm pretty sure it's the same thing.

Hyland's Homeopathic Baby Colic - 125 Tablets, Pack of 2;B007V92FGA;[0, 1];5.0;Now that my son is almost a year and a half, it's easier to administer these dissolveable tablets than to give him gripe water for gas.  As a younger baby, I would use a syringe to give gripe water, but now he turns his head and doesn't want it.  Also, if he wakes up in the middle of the night with gas, it down't wake him up to put a couple of these just inside his mouth where they immediately melt.  They work very well to ease gas pains.  He often gets gassy after trying new fresh fruit and on those nights I just give him a couple of these at bedtime to help with digestion.  They're natural and safe.  I do recommend reading a book or two about the administration of homeopathic medicine to children though, just so parents understand the sysytem behind herbal meds.;12 8, 2012;A184LJ5IUG2JN6;"Maria Rasmussen ""kittybaby13""";Great for Colic, Gas from New Foods;1354924800

;B007V9QKH0;[4, 25];3.0;Before I get blasted with flames, I like this game, a little - it was worth the 30 bucks I paid for it, but no more. In fact it is hard not to like this game if you've played Capcom's Dungeons and Dragons. My complaint is actually the art. The wild, cartoonish look of the Characters and especially the enemies doesn't go well with this hack and slash. It kind of makes the game Boring. Really. So the game's beautiful, I get it. Nice Ta-ta's, Okay. The game just doesn't have the feel - it's got the D&D feel, yes. But it is not on par with Odin Sphere, in fact it feels like an even more boring version of D&D to me. Some parts feel rushed, others feel well done - the game is a mixed bag.;08 10, 2013;A8B96DMW7UUQ5;Chris Cunningham;Not as good as Odin Sphere;1376092800

;B007V9QKH0;[1, 1];5.0;My oh my did I enjoy this game, whether I played alone or with a few friends in local co-op.Enjoy games like a Castle Crashers, Golden Axe, Side-scroller beat em' ups and can admire a fantastic art designs? This games for YOU!I must say I really, really enjoyed the combat in this game it is very fluid and feels smooth. The loot system is great too, there is a huge variety of weapons to find and choose from. The RPG elements are nice, at times they take a backseat to the loot system. Otherwise the enemy's types are really cool and there is a good amount of variety to them. Their are 9 dungeons each can take about 20-30 minutes and after you beat those 9 you unlock alternative roots that you take to fight new bosses and enemies which take around 30-40 minutes. The game can take around 12 hours to complete and after that you unlock NEW GAME + which adds a great amount of variety. If you don't have friends to play it with there is always online co-op which is unlocked around level 10, there is even bots that you can eventually pick and choose who will fight with you. There are also side quests they your going to want to complete which will take add numerous amounts of replay ability to each dungeon.Overall the game is simple and at the same time simply amazing. If your on the fence about this game or even waiting for a price drop, just go for it. This game is totally worth 40-50 dollars, I was waiting for it to hit 20 dollars and I'm sure glad I didn't.

;B007VTY1VC;[0, 1];4.0;"This volume is the start of an epic and it rolls along filling in the details, an easy read. A baggy, generous style for a strong story line.The book is well proofed and edited, especially the first half, with only a few odd typos/mistakes.Graice is a Sistere (white robe) and Sybille is a Madrere (light blue robe): they are nun-like women with awesome psychic powers over the simple folk amongst whom they live. These members of the Sisteria have an 'effect' they can put onto everybody, except the enigmatic and amnesiac Holder who becomes their guide on a wagon trip from the huge city of Matik to Lucidus. They can also see the Auras of people (including Holder)and read minds.There is plenty of very natural dialogue but sometimes it's a little hard to put a face to the voice.Possibly the author introduces too many characters early on. There are three or four sets of them. It tests the reader's memory and patience. At one point a new set, including a 'man in gray' and Cenaltan the Hibbrian, after: Fabiyan and Grammi;Graice and Sybille; Rafe and Belo; Myron and Izak.The dreaded Zafiri are creating like a holocaust scenario with their helpers the Yuzoi.You could do with a list of the characters, with descriptions, in a saga like this.Rafe and Belo are a comic turn. Rafe is a lupun and Belo a kiropteran. 'Persons' but with some of the attributes of a wolf (Rafe) and a bat (Belo).

This series is so addicting.Being blinded after an accident leaves full-of-life Cody depressed and withdrawn. Months of not doing the things he loves is more than he can take. Pushing people away seems to be his business these days. His family is worried about him. He's not interested in anything and is sort of just withering away. He's cut off most of his friends and his family, except for the brother who's working his butt off to keep two ranch's running. He won't leave the ranch, he barely eats enough to get by. His father is sick of his wallowing in his own sorrow. So his father goes to a place that trains dogs for the blind, and hires Lyssa McElhannon for a month to get his son set up so that he can function like a normal person again. Before Lyssa shows up his father suddenly leaves town, because he know the fireworks are coming when Cody finds out what he did.Sure enough...when Lyssa shows up with the dog in tow, Cody fights her every step of the way.

Musically, the song is a blast, as was most everything IH did until Ronno's untimely demise - but (really, there are just no words) ""We Gotta Get Out Of Here"" is enhanced exponentially by the presence of Ellen Foley doing, basically, the same thing to IH that she did to Meatloaf a scant three years earlier.  ""Welcome To The Club"" costs a pot, and I know""Outa Here"" is available on other ""greatest hits,"" although you have to look - but, trust me on this one: that one song with Ellen Foley makes every penny you pay for the CD or the MP3 (I still don't know what that means) more than worthwhile.";10 28, 2013;A31KXTOQNTWUVM;Bill Board;Everything IH Did with Ronno was great;1382918400

Intricate White Faux Pearl Clear Crystal Rhinestone Bouquet Design Pin Brooch;B007XZBPIG;[0, 0];4.0;I wanted a pearl pin spray for a sweater coat that is black and white and found this one from Ailiang.  I had never ordered from them but gave them a try and purchased this as well as two other pins.  They arrived packaged in bubble wrap in a substantial box.  I feel that for the price this pin was a great buy.  The pearls are approximatley 7mm and bright white and the rhinestones are crystal clear.  I did not notice from the photo before ordering but this pin is ment to be worn with the pearl section pointing down.  However, if you work with it you could wear it reversed or even side to side as it is photographed. I have two complaints........one you have to work with the closure to get it to slide in and properly shut.  It is a bit off center.  Secondly, I had just put the pin on for the first time and walked into my tiled bathroom and heard something hit the floor.  One of the pearls had fallen off.  Luckily I heard it and found it.  Then I had to go buy superglue to reglue it. However, most of my pins I coat with a thin layer of clear fingernail polish just to be sure that the stones stay in place. If it were not for the fact that I had to repair the pin before I could wear it I would have given five stars.;12 29, 2012;A27FP0S5QH7GNE;IslandSandy;Looks like real pearls!;1356739200

That's four and a half albums of glorious music padded out to ten albums in this monster set. The other albums included aren't bad -almost nothing Mingus recorded is devoid of interest- but they're decidedly second drawer, and the posthumously recorded Epitaph (1989), a set of Mingus compositions for large ensemble, conducted by Gunther Schuller, almost sinks under its own weight, so unwieldy is it.  (But even in this ponderous album, there are moments of startling beauty and power. Mingus could write!)For all the praise Mingus got in his lifetime -and it was a lot!-- he didn't get enough.As a composer and arranger, as the leader of small and middle-sized bands, and as bass player, he was incomparable and sui generis, the greatest jazz composer and arranger since Jelly Roll Morton and Ellington. And those two names deserve to be bracketed with his because Mingus, more than any other composer, melded the music of his predecessors from the earliest days of jazz up through the swing era and into and beyond bop into one powerful, intensely lyrical music. Listening to a Mingus album was often a symposium on the history and richness of jazz. His compositions were often deliberately self-referential, from gospel songs (""Better Git It In Your Soul"" in Ah Um and Epitaph, ""Slop"" on Dynasty, ""Wednesday Evening Prayer Meeting"" in Atlantic's great Blues and Roots), a comic but loving nod toward Morton (""Jelly Roll"" on Ah Um and again on Blues and Roots), his paean for Lester Young (""Goodbye Pork Pie Hat"" on Ah Um), Ellington ballads (Mercer Ellington's ""Things Ain't What They Used to Be"" and ""Mood Indigo"" on Dynasty) to bop and beyond (Gil Fuller's and Dizzy Gillespie's ""Ool-ya-koo"" on Mingus and Friends ""Bird Calls"" and ""Gunslinging Bird"" on, respectively, Ah Um and Dynasty).The first thing one notes is what a great leader Mingus was. To start with, he was a consummate bass player, who moved with ease from walking bass to obbligato and offbeat figures, even strumming, all the time leading musicians along the path he wanted them to follow.  Nobody ever played walking bass better than Mingus. To start with, nobody had stronger hands. Nobody -maybe Charlie Haden-- brought such a rich, deep, woody sound from his instrument. Listening to him in conjunction with recordings of the other great bassists of the late forties through the sixties -Oscar Pettiford or Ray Brown, for instance--is a revelation as to how great a player Mingus was.And nobody played so well in the tradition (he had honed his playing in the biggest of the big bands, Ellington's, and the most intimate of combos, Norvo's guitar-bass-vibes trio) and yet so idiosyncratically. Mingus's compositional mind was rich in idiosyncrasy. It's common for a Mingus tune to start in one tempo or mood and switch gears back and forth, over and over again, in the space of a few minutes. His compositions, and the performances of them, are rich in complexity. You have to keep paying attention to them or you lose track and miss nuances. There's no such thing as a `simple' ballad in Mingus's oeuvre. See for instance the interweaving in slo mo of the beautiful melody ot ""All the Things You Are,"" as countermelody in Mingus's ""Self-Portrait in Three Colors"" (Ah Um) or the way the band takes off on a tear near the end of ""Mood Indigo"" (Dynasty).I cut my eyeteeth on Ah Um (the first album I bought), Dynasty, and Tijuana Moods so I'm particularly fond of them. ""Better Git It in Your Soul"" still seems the best of Mingus's Sunday night Bible meeting songs but I appreciate ""Slop"" more this time: it's not a throwaway as I thought when I first heard it but rather another composition and performance in the same genre. ""Boogie Stop Shuffle"" and ""Fables of Faubus"" are still wonderful, and ""Goodbye, Pork Pie Hat"" is one of the great compositions, arrangements and performance in modern jazz. This time around, I understood what was at play in ""Jelly Roll."" ""Bird Calls"" is a great composition -bop on speed- but features an awful solo by pianist Horace Parlan, usually one of Mingus's better pianists.  But that's what you get with Mingus -brilliance mixed with a touch of the ramshackle. I think that's what he was trying to get out of his musicians, driving them to play outside their comfort zones.Ah Um is still a more coherent album that Dynasty but Dynasty contains longer, more `composed` pieces-notably ""Diane"" and ""New Know, Know How""--that make sense to me now although they didn't fifty years ago. They're not my favorites but they showcase his unbelievably fertile musical imagination.They may have released an alternate cut of ""Boogie Stop Shuffle"" in this set. I haven't played my vinyl album of Ah Um for years but John Handy's (Shafi Hadi's?) introductory solo on this piece doesn't play out the way I remember it. Secondly, Mingus's ballad ""Strolling,"" with vocal by Honey Gordon (never one of my favorites) has been added to Dynasty and the piece is weak, both in lyrics and performance.The double-album concert with ""friends"" is a mixed bag, some very good stuff, some not so good but still worth listening to. Bill Cosby's stiff and overly arch introductions could have been dispensed with: they add nothing to the occasion. The album does bring to light one observation about Mingus, though. His music possesses a rare ability: for all that it is often modernist, it provokes the best in conservative soloists out of swing or mainstream bop, as well as more modern players (as in his later collaborations on Candid with Dolphy).  On the Friends CDs that means tenor sax giant Gene Ammons soloes shoulder to shoulder with Charles McPherson and Lonnie Hillyer, Milt Hinton alternates bass solos with Mingus, and there's room for sui generis musicians like Gerry Mulligan, Lee Konitz and Randy Weston to contribute their individual voices. The ensemble is unwieldy and not as well rehearsed as it could have been but it makes for interesting listening.I have little to say about Let My Children and Epitaph. The ensembles in both are so large that it drowns the music. Of the two, Children is the better. Epitaph should have been strangled at birth, in my opinion, but, again, I don't know of any Mingus album that doesn't offer some delights.";02 11, 2013;A3R9HPWFF9QWSN;"David Keymer ""David Keymer""";PRICY BUT INDISPENSABLE;1360540800

The product itself does what it is supposed to, holds bags, although I think the suggested 30 bags is a gross over estimate. I would say 15-20 would be a better assessment. I read so many reviews saying be careful about sticking it because it wont come off the wall. Well every time i pull a bag out it comes off the wall. The tape took the paint off the wall too. I screwed it into the wall but because if the constant pulling when grabbing a bag the screws came out of the wall. I will now get Sheetrock screws and put it in and I assume that will work.

Mixed Colors Water Pearls;B0080ZBSO4;[1, 2];5.0;"I purchased these for my four year old to play with in a sensory bin; rather than for the intended purpose of filling vases.  They are so neat!  The package looks so tiny when it comes in the mail, but once you soak them in water, they puff up to the size of marbles.  They are great for a sensory bin because they feel really neat to run your hands through, and my daughter loves scooping them into containers.  Mess note - they do bounce and roll when they fall, so the child has to take care not to drop them.  Also, the child must handle them rather gently because if they are squeezed, they burst and make a mess.  My daughter loves this multi-color package, and she often sorts them by color.  Highly recommend these for a sensory bin for a child old enough to use care with the beads and not put them in their mouth.  One package of these is enough to fill a shoebox once they are puffed up...so a small package goes a long way!If you purchase these for the intended use of vase filler - they really are beautiful and are nice colors!

Simoniz S57 Perfect Finish Detailing Clay Bar;B0081OSRQQ;[34, 36];5.0;"I've used clay magic for years and recently found this more convenient 100 gram size.  The kit you may have seen includes a 200 gram bar and the clay lubricant, also available on amazon.  In my opinion this is a better value.  Another reviewer suggested using soapy water in a spray bottle however, I suggest a product like Optimum no rinse concentrate found here:  http://www.amazon.com/32oz-Optimum-Rinse-Wash-Shine/dp/B000E9TS6O  You can make gallons of clay lubricant with this one bottle.As far as using the clay, you will want to hand wash your car.  Using a microfiber mitt will yield good results, using two buckets with grit guards will yield even better results.  Once your car is clean a dried you can then begin claying a 2x2' section at a time. Park your car in the shade or in a garage, mist the clay lubricant onto the paint when the car is cool, keeping in mind a warm car will require more lube due to evaporation.  Flatten the clay and press into your working hand, proceed by moving the clay in a back and fourth motion, letting the clay do the work.  The neat part about clay is you can actually feel and hear it working like an erasure for all the environmental fallout like, bugs, tar, sap, road grime and even mild over spray.  When you're done with one section, wipe off with a microfiber towel, kneed the clay revealing a fresh area and move on to the next section.It's a good idea to plan on waxing your car after you clay it as some marring may occur.  Waxing will hide all or most of this marring, if it even does happen. I've found this happens more often on darker finishes.  There really isn't any point to waxing your car unless you've treated the paint to a clay bar treatment.  If you're on the fence about clay bar treatments, try sliding your hand across your ""clean paint.""  If it doesn't feel like glass and grit free then you need clay.

;B0081UEXPE;[2, 2];4.0;Review originally posted on my website, From the Mind of TatlockAfter reading and highly enjoying Sudden Death Overtime, by author Steve Vernon, I got my hands on another book of his, titled: Tatterdemon and boy, was I in for another delightful treat. Read on to see what the story is all about and whether you should pick it up or not...Short nitty-gritty plot description from the back cover is as follows: In 1691 the town of Crossfall taught the witch Thessaly how to die. They beat her, they shot her, they hung her - but nothing worked. When they finally tried to bury her alive Thessaly set the field against them. The first man died as a gust of wind harrowed the meat from his bones. A root,flung like a dirty javelin, cut a second man down. Many more deaths followed. The Preacher Fell impaled the witch upon her very own broom but she dragged him down into the field to wait for three more centuries.Three hundred years later Maddy Harker will murder her bullying husband Vic. She will bury him in the field as she buried her abusive father years before that. The very same field where the revenant spirit of Thessaly Cross lies waiting.In three days Vic will rise again - a thing of dirt, bone and hatred.Men will call him the Tatterdemon.And hell - and Thessaly - will follow.The story starts off 300 years ago, as the witch Thessaly Cross is being buried in a field. It turns out that the townsfolk have been trying very hard to kill this witch and they just can't seem to get the job done. So, the priest, Preacher Abraham Fell, vows to end her life, by burying her in a field, with a pile of rocks on top of her. Things don't go exactly as planned and the witch uses her power to murder several people and curse the town of Crossfall for an eternity.We jump ahead 300 years and get introduced to a bunch of strange people, that now inhabit the same town, Crossfall. Not one person is normal in this town, be it the town drunk, who dresses as a preacher, even though he isn't and lives in the abandoned church, the retired freak show, who is just trying to lose some weight, the voodoo woman, who works at the police station, or even our main character Maddy, who is continuously abused by her husband Vic, until one day she can't take it and brains his skull in with a frying pan and buries him in the field, the same field that houses the witch, Thessaly, who has been slowly waiting and building power over time. Because of this, Maddy doesn't realize that Vic isn't going to stay dead for long and instead is going to be reborn a different, but stronger man, known as the Tatterdemon. All hell is about to break loose in Crossfall and not a single insane person will be safe.What a read Tatterdemon was. It's start off super quick, with the burying of the witch and soon gets you on the edge of your seat, as Steve Vernon introduces character after character, each with their own dirty secret, that invokes almost a Twin Peaks vibe with the towns craziness. I loved that he spent time with each character, with several chapters dedicated to each person, as you got to witness the terror unfold through several characters perspectives. It never feels dull and it shouldn't, as the violence and mayhem presented here, is through the freaking roof. People are dieing left and right in gory fashion and no one is safe.There are a few small problems with the book however. There are some editing problems, where the wrong name of a character is written and it left me confused for a second, until I realized it was just a grammatical error. Unfortunately this happens more than once and it can take you out of the story. I'm thinking one more go through with the editor, would've been beneficial. Also, things can get so crazy and insane, you might have a challenge keeping up with everything that is happening. There were times where I thought a certain character was dead, but the next paragraph he seemed to be alive and well. I actually had to go back a few pages and make sure I read it right and I did, so that left me a little confused. Also, the ending does come up fairly fast in regrades to the resolution of the witch and I wished a little more time would've been spent dealing with her. Still, the last page left me craving more, as Steve Vernon wisely leaves you on a cliffhanger.The small negatives are only going to bring the score down a little, as the overall package is pretty damn impressive. The story keeps moving at a hummingbird's pace and you'll want to keep reading, even if the clock strikes 2am and you need to work in the morning. With that said, I highly recommend picking up Tatterdemon, especially if you love a fast paced story, with witches, demons, ghosts, violence, gore and a certain quirkiness, that will at times pull a chuckle out of you.Rating: 4/5 (-1 for some grammatical issues and occasionally story confusion. +4 for a highly interesting story, gore and an ending that leaves you wanting more.);09 9, 2013;A2VMTE2WRYLB9Q;From the Mind of Tatlock;You'll want to keep reading, even if the clock strikes 2am and you need to work in the morning;1378684800

Seagate Backup Plus 3TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive for Mac (STCB3000900);B00829TIEK;[1, 2];4.0;"This is a nice external hard drive which makes an excellent back up device for Time Machine, a Mac OSX feature that is probably underutilized by most Mac users. It has a number of cables to connect it to your Mac (USB 2.0, FireWire 400 and FireWire 800). The real speedy connection is Thunderbolt which requires both a Thunderbolt enabled Mac with a special adapter or USB 3.0 which also requires the purchase of an adapter.The main competition in the Mac world for Time Machine-friendly devices is theApple Time Capsule 2TB MD032LL/A [NEWEST VERSION]. It costs about twice as much as this Seagate drive, but it backs up wirelessly. Over the air initial backups and restorations are much slower than using a hard wired approach. However you do not need to remember to plug them in every day. The Time Capsule can simultaneously back up several Mac computers over a Wifi connection. From Seagate's perspective speed ought to be the principal selling feature, The optional Thunderbolt or USB 3.0 ought to be standard.Seagate also misses its mark by promoting a seamless, nice and enigmatic backup for Facebook pictures and video, Flickr and You Tube content. This material is by definition already in the FB, Flickr and You Tube cloud. and the pictures are likely in the free part of iCloud as well. If that's not enough backing up for you, Seagate gives free cloud space of its own.Finally this just isn't a Mac device. It has installation instructions for Windows as well. The naming of this device as being ""for Mac"", while technically accurate is not entirely candid. I attribute this mislabeling to the folks who are selling automatic backup of cloud stored material.Does it work? Yes.Is it fast? Yes, but it could be blazingShould you buy it? That depends on the environment you wish to use it. On a small WiFi Mac network, the more expensive Time Capsule is your better option.

Seagate Backup Plus 3TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive for Mac (STCB3000900);B00829TIEK;[1, 2];4.0;"I own a laptop running Windows 7 and saw that the Seagate Backup Plus 3 TB USB 3.0 external hard drive was compatible with Windows, which was why I decided to request one. Since I do not own a Mac or any of the software you can use the hard drive with, I cannot comment on that. However, I found the setup of the hard drive for Windows to be easy. You do need to download and install a file so that the hard drive will read in Windows. The pamplet included with the hard drive tells you where to go to download the extension file. It takes a couple minutes to download and once you reboot your computer, the hard drive will show up under ""My Computer."" The hard drive does run very quiet, the only indication that it is running is the light that shines from the front of it. I copied several GB worth of files onto it and it did so in a decent amount of time.I do wish the USB cable included with the hard drive was longer. It's about 2 feet long. My old hard drive that died on me had a cable that was about 4-5 feet long. I had to rearrange things around my desk to accomodate the shorter cable but it's not really a huge issue. I thought it interesting that it comes with an European/Korean adapter if you travel so you can plug the hard drive into foreign outlets.Anyways, so far it is a great hard drive to replace my old one which lasted about 7 years.

They generally work pretty well, albeit with the pretty serious caveat that mixing and matching drives to their bases is unreliable - the result is often that the drive will abruptly cease functioning, causing data loss and requiring you to unplug and re-plug it to the computer to get it back again.  But so long as you only use the drive & controller that shipped to you together, they seem to be reliable.Performance is fine, in the sense that it's as fast as Firewire 800 or USB 2 can go.It's pretty quiet overall.

After pressing a few more times, I gave up to switch the batteries from the red to the white to test if it had come with dead batteries.I opened the non-working one to remove the batteries, and noticed the battery holder was a little flimsy. I decided to take the entire circuit out (it's only about 1.5cm in diameter). Lo and behold, the little metal flap holding the batteries in place (and completing the circuit) fell off into my carpet.Well done, whoever did (or didn't) do the soldering!2 stars because one of them works (fortunately it's the more important one);09 4, 2012;A2CXRYMLSCU2VI;Dan;well, this is silly;1346716800

"Teeter Hang Ups EP-560 Ltd Inversion Table w/ bonus Acupressure Nodes &amp; Lumbar Bridge";B0084FD94C;[4, 4];5.0;I bought this for Christmas for my husband. He had been struggling with severe back pain caused by statins. Last May, he was put on cholesterol pills for cholesterol in the low 300's.  Within a month he started to have pain like you do when you pull your sciatic -radiating pain in the back, butt, and all the way down the leg.  We found out the statins he was on ate away his nerve endings. Obviously he quit the pills.  After several thousands of dollars in medical bills, tests, physical therapy, and seeing a chiropractor, he was at his wits end.  It effected everything he did.  He went from being very active, working out 6 days a week, skiing, biking, etc. to nothing.  The doctor's finally told him there was nothing they could do.  His nerve endings would have to rest and grow back - hopefully.  While channel surfing, I saw an infomercal about Teeter Hangups and thought maybe this would help my husband. I bought the Teeter EP560 through their website.  They gave a 30 day garuntee that it would work and I would not have to pay to ship it back if it didn't.  At this point, what could we loose? We have had it since the beginning of January.  We both have been using it daily.  Today is 1/18/14 and last night, my husband told me that yesterday was the first day since May that he was able to do a V-sit sit up with no pain.  He is sleeping soundly and is able to move around again.  I know this might sound hookie but it works!  I feel better and more rested. My husband's back/butt/leg pain is gone.  He is more happier which makes both of us more happier.  I would of bought it from Amazon,  but the Teeter website offers 30 day no risk try out and a payment plan.  It took 6 days for us to receive it as oppose to 2 days from Amazon.  I highly recommend this product to anyone that has back or leg pain.  It is wonderful!;01 18, 2014;A1R2SEU7PIZ7KB;Patdrin;My husband's back pain is gone!;1390003200

;B0084KFV8E;[0, 1];2.0;"I never write reviews; I've probably written at most one or two over the past decade. However, in this case I felt I needed to do something to balance out the disproportionate number of reviews gushing over how great this story was. Perhaps they only read book one? It starts out well enough, I enjoyed the first book and would probably have given it a three or possibly even four star rating had I stopped there. It had an interesting premise and although I didn't really love any of the characters, I still thought it was a good read. The main character, Nina, was spoiled and selfish, repeatedly used others to get what she wanted, and then claimed to feel bad about it later even as she continued. Jared was so constantly in awe of her it bordered on pathetic. Even the rest of the supporting characters seemed to fawn and dote over Nina for no apparent reason. The plot also became more and more outlandish as the story progressed. I get that it's fiction, but come on, lets at least try to be consistent with the character's motivations and actions. This all continues throughout the second and third book, gets increasingly annoying, and reaches the point of complete ridiculousness by the climax of the third book. In fact, the last few chapters were so bad that they alone were enough to change my perspective of the series from 'mediocre but entertaining' to 'huge waste of time.' If you must, get them from the library, but don't buy them. The only reason it gets two stars is because I was entertained most of the way through, one star was really tempting though.";10 8, 2013;A3RONO9KL64D32;mallowfly18;Gets Progressively Worse;1381190400

V-8 Energy Shot, 2.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12);B0084ZZ5PI;[0, 0];5.0;I tired the V-8 Energy Shot as part of the Amazon Vine program and I thought mine tasted great.  It reminded me of a happy hour berry rum drink.  It was quite tasty and no wierd aftertaste or fake sugar taste either.  If V-8 offers this drink without the caffeine I would purchase it for myself as I like the mixture of vitamins as well but I drink green tea (as well as black and white tea) only when de-caffeinated so as to get the great antioxidants without the caffeine which can send you on a bad fatigued adrenal cycle.

It also has a bit of an after taste. The taste itself would be worth enduring if it gave you extra energy, but I have to say, I didn't really notice much of a boost at all.

;B00855B27C;[0, 0];5.0;Dark Roots of Earth is an impressive thrash metal album. It's heavy, aggressive, and the vocals are imposing.

Manitoba Harvest Hemp Hearts, Raw Shelled Hemp Seeds, 1 Pound;B00856TSCC;[0, 1];5.0;"My husband and I were inspired by the books &#34;Eat to Live&#34; and &#34;The China Study&#34; to clean up our diets and eat healthier, whole foods. As part of our new diet, we try to get in as many varieties of whole foods every day, from different vegetables and fruits, to a huge medley of seeds and grains. The hemp hearts are the newest addition to our pantry of stable foods. Here's what we've learned about them so far:1. I can't find them at the grocery store--not the regular grocery store I use or the health food store I frequent. I was hoping to find them in bulk for cheaper, but they are nowhere to be found in my city. Therefore, Amazon is my resource, so I'm perfectly happy with the price, even though at first it seemed high to me.2. At first, I thought I'd add them to my morning cereal, along with my regular additions of flax seed and chia seed. However, the taste was just not appealing to me. To be perfectly honest, I thought they tasted like snot. My husband thinks they taste more like mushrooms. I couldn't bring myself to eat them in my cereal though, so we decided to hide them in other foods.3. My husband makes a delicious granola with almonds and coconut. He started adding a cup of the hemp hearts to the recipe. I love the granola and can't taste the hemp hearts at all...so I put about a quarter cup of the granola on my morning cereal and get the health benefits of the hemp hearts. We also add them to breads.The packaging says to try sprinkling them on yogurt, but that just wouldn't suit my taste buds...so get creative! There's definitely a way to enjoy the health benefits of these even if you don't love the flavor!";04 28, 2014;A2EEQMVVGR1YWU;Pheebster's Mom;Not so delicious, but good for you!;1398643200

;B008646114;[4, 4];3.0;"Putumayo's introduction to this series is all about the music of the traditional arabic roots mingles with the contemporary flavor across the Mediterranean. I find the series live up to my expectation- very uplifting, upbeating,  and the overall music selections, to some extend, have the arabic traditional shadow and sound. Definitely VERY modern. Couple tracks have a relative heavier techno flavor.That said, though, the entire album seems a little too blend. Nothing stands out, the music choices are too 'safe' so to speak. The only two tracks I find to be the weakest links are track 7 and 8, by Ahmed Soultan and Choub&egrave;ne respectively. Otherwise, the rest are pleasant enough to be played as background music, but this is probably not an album I'd like to play over and over again.If you are shopping for something more on the traditional side, you'll find this is a disappointing album. But if you like contemporary and uplifting arabic music, I'd say this is a safe choice, but definitely not the best choice.

Idrotherapy Wrinkle Reducer (0.5 oz);B0086B2DLE;[3, 3];1.0;I purchased the Idrotherapy product after an advertisement popped up on my computer.  The advertisement stated that you could purchase a trial Idrotherapy for $3.98, and after 18 days if you didn't cancel your order they would charge you $99.99.  Okay, so I ended up paying over the $99.99 for the product. After another week (almost a month)of trying this product, I really hadn't see any difference over what I was already using.  When I called to cancel the Idrotherapy I was told that if I continued buying the product, and not cancel, they would charge me only $29!  There is a big difference between $100.00 and $29. So needless to say this company is a rip off and because of this I will not be buying any beauty product on line again without thoroughly checking it out first.

;B0086GCZ9E;[0, 1];2.0;"*1.5/2 Stars*I really tried to get into this story. Trust me, I did. But, it just didn't pull through. The blurb sounded promising, but this story was a letdown for me.Katie, Marcus and Owen's relationship felt unrealistic and unbelievable and I know as readers we have to suspend beliefs and reality in certain stories, but this one just had me going, ""Really?""Another thing is that I felt a huge disconnect with the characters. Not only that, but I felt no connection between the characters themselves. There was no sexual buildup or chemistry. It all felt very blah to me. The characters could have been more developed in my opinion. They were very close to cardboard characters and didn't interest me at all. The sex scenes didn't have any heat or passion to them. They didn't fog up my Kindle or get my heart racing. Another thing is the dialogue; it was quite awkward for me & it felt a bit forced.Overall, it's sad to say, but I was bored throughout the story which made this a painful read. I skimmed pages to see if the story would get interesting, but sadly it didn't. When I read a story, no matter how long or short, I long to feel connected to the characters and story. Unfortunately, the story and characters fell flat in this one and so I didn't care about what happened to the characters in the end. I thought that I would enjoy Tempted by Two because it sounded like a read I would enjoy, but it left me disappointed.*Ecopy received from the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for a honest review.";05 24, 2013;A1A2UUBPN2AMTO;Nina;Tempted by Two by Portia Da Costa;1369353600

;B0086OO07G;[9, 9];4.0;I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review. All thoughts contained within are my honest thoughts and feelings about the book.Heritage Avenged: Enchanted Bookstore Legend Two is the second book in the Enchanted Bookstore series. Let me say upfront that I read this book without having read the first book of the series, so I don't think that I got the full impact of the story. In this story, Lyra McCauley, a writer and English professor, receives a letter from the doctor who performed the autopsy on her aunt. When she speaks to the doctor, he confirms that nothing medically explains her aunt's death, bolstering the suspicion that she was killed magically.Now, for those who haven't read the first book...Lyra McCauley is a writer and loves fantasy novels, but until she opens a selection from bookstore owner Cullen Drake, she has no idea he's a wizard character who lives a double life inside that volume...or the story's magic will compel her from the edge of depression to adventure, danger, and love.Lyra starts to learn how to use her magic, but due to an attack that causes her lover and bonded mate, Cullen Drake, serious injury, her lessons are accelerated so that she can help to heal his injuries.Moore weaves a tale of love, magic and danger that draws you into the story. You want to keep reading and see what happens next for Lyra. I was honestly sad when the book ended and wanted more. I've decided that I need to go back and read the first one. You can pick up the second book and not be lost, but there are references back that don't make a lot of sense if you haven't read the first story.The book was well written, stands alone on it's own and is a great example of fantasy and magic for those who enjoy magic in their stories.;05 28, 2012;A2T332AR68HNW2;"Margaret Kerr ""I read, I write, I live, I lau...";Great Fantasy Story;1338163200

V-MODA VAMP Headphone Amplifier (150mW x 2), DAC, Battery Pack for iPhone 4/4S (Discontinued by Manufacturer);B008801ZFS;[6, 10];5.0;"So my Impressions:IntroductionI have said before, I am against selling what you win or are given, and I am not an apple fan, and have no interest in getting an iPhone. So what was I to do with the VAMP I just won? Well the original idea I had was to give it to my mother to troll around with with her K550's. But it seems fate had other ideas, my friend, helped me win the competition, he was the photographer. But recently he got committed to a psychiatric institution, and I went to visit him. He has an iPhone 4, and I was going to test it with my AKG K242HD and my Denon D7000. But I planned like a prized nob, his iPhone was just replaced, he had no music, and the VAMP was not charged. So it didn't happen. But he did enjoy the AKG's straight out of his iPad, I decided bugger it and left the AKG's and the VAMP with him.The next morning I get 2 messages. ""Holy Jesus!"" ""Thats all.""This particular friend of mine could not discern in quality between my D2000 and his skull candy Ink'd buds using my ASUS Xonar Essence STX (albeit with stock opamps and no impedance adapter at that stage, which means it was harsh and had horrible bass bloat.) So I was quite confused. He says the AKGs sounded great just out of the iPad or the iPhone, but that VAMP, he said it even made the skull candies not sound like turd.HeadphonesI feel I have to talk a bit about the AKG K242HD (same as the K240mkii with velour pads and no detachable cable.) They are underrated around here, and I know why, since this is out of scope I will keep it short (if anyone would like a full review, ask and it shall be done.)Anyway, these $90 bargains I bought are transparent, they sound like whatever you plug them into, their sonic characteristics and quality is a direct reflection of the source/amp. That was very useful when opamp rolling. And in comparison my Denons (D2k or D7k) barely change at all, they are only affected by impedance mismatches, and having enough current and clarity from the source/amp.GearI will be comparing to normal iPhone w/ Golden Ear and my HTC HD2 w/ 64bit NEON enhanced Neutron player, and my Asus Xonar essence stx (with THS4032 opamps in I/V) and an impedance adapter with the denons. The Asus Xonar STX + THS4032 opamps + AKG K242HD combination is a combo I think is particularly synergestic, and I recommend highly to anyone looking for a low budget high quality all rounder system.Headphones: as stated above AKG K242HD, and Denon D7000.ImpressionsSo after getting all the music onto his iPhone in flac format using Golden Ear, we got down to business. I brought my D7000 along aswell, but unless otherwise stated, this is with the AKG K242HDI used songs I knew very very well, and out of the box, the imaging and soundstage is magnificent, the detail retrieval was the biggest killer, it was amazing, I have heard some songs so many times I know every hit and echo backwards, and I was hearing almost double the details I have ever heard with either the AKG or the Denons, and thats the part that hurt, I couldn't help but think why the hell would I buy the D7000's if this is so good.All the songs had a much more intimate feeling, and despite everything that the AKGs could show it was always musical, and the bass was the biggest surprise, it was beautifully textured, and the subbass just got the extra little push it needed on the AKGs (although I will note for heavy electronica an equalizer is still useful.)I never felt the VAMP was slow, or hiding anything or overly bright, which the AKGs can be.When I plugged in my Denon D7000, there was improvement, but my time was much too little to give an affirmative answer, but I do think the improvement WAS NOT so great. The reason is because in the AKG's + VAMP combo the VAMP follows the single colourating (yes I just made up a word) component rule, where with the denons both are adding colouration, and the result was still great clarity, but nowhere near the wow of the AKGs and tbh, I would rather have the VAMP + AKG combo, there is no way I would be able to justify the D7000. But I would need more time to say how close they actually are, but from the brief experience:AKG K242HD + VAMP >> Denon D7000 + VAMP/Asus >> AKG K242HD + AsusConclusionThis has taught me (actually just reinforced my belief) that just as implementation matters more with a DAC then the chip itself, that synergy matters greater then the sum of the components.As a basic rule you want one colourating component in a chain. With the denons, they have their own strong natural sound so you want a neutral and transparent amp, which explains why except for the odd exception they are suited best for solid state amps. With the AKGs they are transparent in their sound and benefit from the added musicality of colouration in an amp. The HD800 fits into the same category from my reading.The synergy between the AKGs and the VAMP is utterly disgusting (in a good way) and because of the transparent nature of the AKGs I can conclusively say the VAMP is a great product. So great infact that I almost considered getting an iPhone, and I would have, but I thought the VAMP would find a good home with my friend, so I gave it to him.  And I will buy the Go-dap X based VAMP when its released. Now I just haveto tell my mother I have given way the VAMP I was going to give her.... gulp....";07 30, 2012;A3OBG5JV2VDCT6;"R.

;B00881VLCE;[0, 0];5.0;FANTASTIC puzzle for my 5 yr old non-verbal, Autistic daughter. She plays it every day.

I noticed some changes but I didn't start a puzzle so I don't know about all the changes. This is the second time there was an update & I lost my downloads. I never had a rotating problem because I figured the orientation was correct to start with because rotating wasn't possible. I wish the puzzles had contrasting backgrounds, sometimes the pieces are almost impossible to see. And the carousel where the unused pieces are stored is sometimes difficult to use. And once the frame is constructed, I think it should be anchored to the background instead of moving around every time it is touched.;08 22, 2012;A1SQAE1CZQCCSF;;CONFUSING & FRUSTRATING;1345593600

Red Dingo Classic Dog Harness;B0088KI5Y2;[0, 0];3.0;"The fabric material is durable and fairly heavy duty, plenty for the size dog this size harness can fit, but the clasps (there are two; one on either side of the shoulder) are plastic and for some reason I thought they would be metal.

I like colors that can be seen at night for safety.The size is where I give the stars. It may be user error and I may be harsh, but I measured my Pomeranian (granted, he is a throwback pom, and about 22 lb) around the chest with a fabric tape and got 18&#34; (and no I didn't measure starting backwards on the tape).

VIZIO All-in-One CA24-A1 24-Inch Desktop;B0088L18DQ;[11, 22];2.0;I bought this from the Microsoft on-line store as part of their signature series. They wouldn't allow my review on their site, so I'm putting one here.I am a tech coordinator for a small school. I have bought dozens and dozens of computers for myself over the years, and hundreds for the school. This is one of the biggest disappointments I've had in a computer purchase.First -- no DVD drive in the machine. I never noticed that in the tech specs, and would never have bought it if I did. Fortunately, I have an external Blu-Ray player.Second -- the worse input devices I've ever used. The trackpad is terrible. If I leave the computer for a while, when I come back it takes about 5 seconds for it to start working again. Once it quit working for almost a full day. The keyboard has no numeric keypad, and the regular keys are HUGE, making it hard to touch type--the reach to the backspace key is impossible.Third -- only 4 USB ports. One for the DVD, one for wireless keyboard/mouse, now I'm down to two. That's not enough!! To make matters worse, 3 of the 4 are at the back of the monitor stand, so whenever you need to switch those cables, you have to go to the back of the computer. The ports are at the bottom of the monitor stand, barely 1/2 inch above the desk. The bottom part of the stand is recessed inwards about 1/2 inch, so it is quite difficult to plug in a cable without careful examination you can't see the ports without dropping your head/eyes down to desk level.  The one port that IS on the side is right next to the power switch. More than once I've accidentally turned the computer off when trying to plug a cable in to that side port.Looking at the photos on-line of this computer, it seemed like a great design. In actual use, it's terrible.The computer itself runs well, but nothing out of the ordinary considering it cost $1000. But plan on spending extra for a decent wireless keyboard/mouse and a USB hub before you have a useable system.;09 1, 2012;A2V4YQKUBJF3RV;Jerel Peterson;Don't buy this;1346457600

;B0088MVODO;[1, 3];1.0;Other than the excellent voice overs, awesome set pieces and gruesome monsters, every aspect about the gameplay in RE6 is terrible.As a long time RE fan, I wanted to ignore the horrible reviews that Resident Evil 6 was getting in order to for my own opinion on a franchise that has seldom let me down and more oftern than not, truly given me an excellent gaming experience (notably RE2, RE Nemesis, RE Code Veronica, RE0. RE remake,RE4 and RE5 most recently).As a die hard fan, very little could be sway me unless something was truly horrible. I just finished that last of the main 3 campaigns and have begun Ada Wong's campaign and I just have to stop kidding myself: I hate playing this game. I feel I am wasting my precious time on a game that just keeps pissing me off with awful glitches when I could just replay Dead Space or Batman Arkham games again. What happened to Resident Evil on this game is just perplexing. Read the reviews from reputable reviewers like Gamespot, etc...and I have to say they were all right. This game stinks and I feel ripped off.The driving mechanics stink, there are SO MANY quick time events that the game should just be called RESIDENT EVIL: QUICK TIME EVENT. It wouldn't even be so bad if the qt were good but they're so incredibly bad. As I said above, there's some really great parts about this game that are awesome to look at. However, the gameplay is so bad it ruins everything good about this game.I pre-ordered RE6 Anthology bundle with the limited edition strategy guide and kept my order active despite the early warning signs. Never again. I won't be pre-ordering any RE game any more. My money will go to Dead Space and Batman for those. I'm going to just go replay every old RE game to wash off the stink of this game. It breaks my heart for them because the game looks so good and RE has a stellar legacy. It would have been better to make us wait another 2 years before releasing such a horrible game.I'm not even finishing this one.;01 1, 2013;A2Q2I065EXRI1S;;Diehard RE fan HATES this game;1356998400

They can be quite effective.  Presenting them as an app allows for some configuration options that can make them even better.In this case, those options are:- Choice of a short or long introduction that contains warnings like, ""Don't play this while driving.""- The ability to set the number of times to run through the ""Put you to sleep speech"" from one to eight.- You can select to end the session with a different speech designed to wake you up.All this is well and good.  If you are having trouble sleeping, at night, in class, or while driving, then this app could help.  Like chicken soup, it probably couldn't hurt.What would make it tons better would be the ability to insert a delay between the ""Put you to sleep"" section and the ""wake up speech"", and near as I could tell, there is no way to do that.  If there is a way then the instructions are certainly lacking.This program contains no malware and NO questionable permissions of any kine.

I hesitated to spend this much on the bags, but all in all, I am very pleased with this purchase because I expect them to last a long time compared to the old ones.  They were so thin and filled with some sort of a packet and a bit of sand.

LeapFrog LeapPad2 Explorer Kids' Learning Tablet, Green;B0089RPUHO;[0, 0];4.0;Team LeapPad all the way!  My 9 year old son is still playing with the leap pad after 2 years.  I am very satisfied with how durable and stable this product is. We only had trouble with one cartridge, and I've addressed that on another review.  The leap-pad has gone with us on many trips and outings and still works as well now, as it did when we purchased it 2 years ago.  I use rechargeable batteries to keep it powered.  The battery still lasts  3 - 4 hours.  One set of rechargeable batteries is always in the device and the other set is always plugged in and ready!  It is difficult for my son to open the battery compartment, so I am the one who has to switch out the batteries.  I don't like the cost of the games and downloads. This is the only reason why I give it 4 stars.  You can get the leappad on sale for very reasonable prices, however, the downloads and games don't go on sale that often and even when they do, they are still too expensive.  I would definitely take advantage of bundles.  I don't have regrets about purchasing the leappad or the products.

LeapFrog LeapPad2 Explorer Kids' Learning Tablet, Green;B0089RPUHO;[1, 1];5.0;"My third grade daughter received this LeapPad 2 for Christmas and absolutely loves it! It was her favorite gift for Christmas.As a parent, what I really enjoy about LeapFrog technologies are how easy they are to set up and use. We connected the LeapPad to our laptop using the included USB cable and within ten minutes, we were off and running with it. The Pad is also customizable to your child's learning level. When you create the online profile for your child, you choose their age and grade, and the LeapPad presents them with content based on their age, engaging them at their educational level.The LeaoPad comes by default with these applications: Creativity (create your own cartoon sequence), Video and Camera (take your own pictures, make your own movies), Art Studio (draw and color), Music (learning music such as ""Punctuation"" and ""Sticky Icky Vowels""), My Stuff (where the pictures and movies are stored), My Books (no books are included by default, you need to purchase books), and one free game download, which you will install during the configuration process. My daughter chose Roly Poly Picnic.The included cameras are both front and rear facing, so you can switch camera angles from the front to the back with a simple touch of the stylus.We already owned a pile of Leapster Explorer cartridges , and every single one worked with the new LeapPad 2.We owned several LeapFrog devices, and there were no conflicts with the software on the laptop, this new purchase was simply added to our account and we were able to quickly map our children's profiles to the new device.I am thoroughly satisfied with this new LeapFrog addition!For parents who do not enjoy ""noisy"" toys and games, consider purchasing headphones!

LeapFrog LeapPad2 Explorer Kids' Learning Tablet, Green;B0089RPUHO;[24, 26];3.0;"With an iPad at home, it's often frustrating for everyone to share it - the kids want to play games on it, I want to get work done on it, and no matter how hard we try, invariably someone ends up getting upset.  The LeapPad2 is a good starter tablet for younger kids to play with instead of your electronics.  The apps on here are geared towards kids and educational, the unit is bright and appealing to play with, and for the most part it keeps our kids happily busy.THE TABLET ITSELF - With a 5"" screen that's larger than my iPhone 5, but smaller than some Samsung cell phones, the screen is a good size for kids to explore and play on.  The display is bright, the sound is very clear on the unit, and the chunky feel of the unit makes it great for younger kids.  The plastic is durable and will definitely survive a drop.  Things I really like about the tablet itself is that the stylus is tied to the unit, so there's less chance of it getting lost, and that the battery accesses are not screwed down.  I hate having to find a screwdriver to open the battery case!  The stylus doesn't always stay in the stylus holder as it's held in magnetically, but since it's tied to the unit, it all good.  The touchscreen of the LeapPad is also very responsive.  Added bonus - there is a motion detector in the unit, so it does respond via movement like some iPad/iPhone games.CAMERA - The resolution of the camera isn't great, but it keeps my kids happy.  With a camera on the front of the unit, and on the back of the unit, it works similarly to an iPhone.  The resolution is far from printable, nowhere near the resolution of my crappy old cell phone, but boy - the kids LOVE this thing.  I have to note that the camera lenses are kept fairly safe as they are ""sunk into"" the unit, unlike your standard iPhone or iPad camera.APPS - This unit does comes with 10 apps, but this doesn't mean that it comes with 10 apps that your kids will play with.  The apps include Pet Pad, Camera, MyStuff, My Books, Music, Calculator, Calendar, Clock, Notepad, and one app of your choice.  This is where things irritate me about the LeapPad.  There's only 2 apps your kids will be able to play with off the bat.  The remaining apps are stuff that your kids probably won't play with.  To add insult to injury, most of the good apps in the app store are $20+ EACH.  I did find a few $5 apps, I had to seriously search for them.  That said, the gift card you have will probably not go very far.  This is where the iPad seriously beats out the LeapPad.  I've downloaded a good number of educational games for my kids on the iPad that cost $0.99 or are free.  You'd think LeapFrog would offer a few cheaper options.-Pet Pad:  Great game for the kids.  It's like a Tamagochi that won't die on you.  You can feed, clean, play, and learn with your pet.  There is a writing gameincluded in the Pet Pad that helps kids learn how to write letters correctly.  You can also ""earn"" treats for your pets.-Camera:  The kids LOVE this app.  They can take videos or pictures.  There's also picture editing software, so kids can add stickers/draw on/manipulate photos.-MyStuff:  This is a folder based app that has links for your pictures, videos, stories, and art.  There's no play involved here.-My Books:  If you haven't paid for any books, you won't have anything in here.  Unfortunately this LeapPad comes with ZERO books.  You'll have to pay for them.-Music:  If you haven't paid for any music, you'll have 4 silly songs included here only.  You'll have to pay $5 to download the MP3 player if you want to loadany of your kid's MP3 collection on there.-Calculator: Works like a calculator.  Nothing too special here.-Calendar: It's a calendar.  If you click on a date, it will tell you the date.  You can also enter a note on a date.  It would make a good diary for kids,however, my kids don't use it much.-Clock:  This features a digital and analog clock face.  It's impossible to tell the time to minute on the analog clock face as there are no minute marks.There's also a stopwatch button, if your kid wants to time someone.-Notepad:  This is a digital Post-It Note.  My kids like to pretend they're writing letters here.-App of Your Choice:  You get to pick one out of 3 apps LeapFrog chooses for you.  These are 3 generic apps - none of the Disney/Dreamworks/etc apps that yourkids really want.There is also a ""Sneak Preview"" app that is a running commercial for your kids to want more apps.  I wish I could delete this off the LeapPad.  NOTE:  I was able to get 2 free apps - Alphabet Stew and the eBook ""The Book of Super Awesome Stuff"" by googling ""Free LeapPad2 Apps"".  You can enter these codes from your parent control panel on your computer and get them downloaded to the LeapPad.The Book of Super Awesome Stuff (e-book): 5813 1140 1518 1413Alphabet Stew (game): 5813 0790 4610 4973POWER SUPPLY - This thing runs on 4AA batteries.  This doesn't seem like a lot of batteries, but if you have a kid who plays a LOT, you'll be plowing through a lot of batteries. The batteries last anywhere between 7-9 hours according to LeapFrog.  There is a port where you can plug in AC 9V power, but unfortunately this package does not come with the charger unit.  I lucked out because I have a Bose charger (for the SoundLink Mini) that just happens to fit into the LeapPad.  Check your other electronics in the house - you just might luck out.  If given the choice, I would thrown down the LeapPad2 Power (priced at $99) to get the rechargeable batteries and power supplies.THE MONSTERS INC. ADD ONS - The Mike Gel case fits beautifully on the LeapPad, and has a nice smooth matte feel about it.  It doesn't seem to attract much dirt to it either, and has managed to stay clean for the past week.  It's very soft and is easily applied, although I do wonder about the long term use of this case.  The screen cleaner is a thin piece of cloth...my kids have already lost it.  The stickers are nice, but not really necessary.  I would have rather seen a battery charger instead of these silly stickers.  The add on bonuses for the Monster Inc. pack were nice, but for almost $30 more, I would pass on these add ons unless your kids are really into the movie.While it's a great toy overall, unless your kid is really into Monsters Inc, it may be a better deal buy to get the original LeapPad2.  The only real differences between this unit and the original LeapPad is the case cover, which is blue and features some of the Monsters Inc characters, the gel skin that's shaped like Mike, the stickers, and the $20 gift card.  Since I already own an iPad, I can safely say that in the long run that the iPad with a good protective case would be a more logical choice to get your kids.  While the price tag is much higher initially, after buying a few apps, the LeapPad would cost just as much.  Along with the lack of WiFi, web surfing capabilities, and more advanced apps, it's only a matter of time before we shelf the LeapPad and go back to fighting over the iPad with the kids.  Recommended up until about age 6 or 7...maybe.  I'll let you know if the kids are still playing with it then.";08 28, 2013;A3U029B8Z5WGI2;Katherine Chan;Great Learning Tool, But Apps are Expensive!;1377648000

This is an original Samsung product that comes with a spare original battery. I simply change batteries every morning, leaving the discharged battery in the charger.

;B008AS5UAO;[6, 7];5.0;"In many ways, this new recording of Don Giovanni is spot on, and I rather doubt that any record company could assemble a better cast these days.  Furthermore, if this recording is indicative of the quality to been seen in DG's new Mozart cycle, I am excited to hear Mozart's other mature works performed like this one.  With just a few minor flaws that throw off my full enjoyment of this work, I remain very excited by the final result.The Mahler Chamber Orchestra under the baton of Yannick N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin plays beautifully (with special mention going to the wonderful strings!).  The players respond wonderfully to the conductor's ideas about the work, and their nuance is very much appreciated when considering the loveliness of Mozart's score.  Mr. N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin himself does lead a lovely rendition of the score, but there are moments when it becomes clear that this ""Don"" is a singers' opera, and it feels like the soloists are leading the conductor around by his baton.  This recording is, as we know, the result of several taped concert performances, and I think the benefit of live recordings is the play-by-play of the singers (who, incidentally, work very well as a team in the ensembles), but, in this case, there are moments when N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin seems to lose the profile of the work while the singers do their own thing.  Happily, these incidents are few, and N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin does bring out moments of great beauty and clarity, and the music is frequently alive with heated emotion.As for the singers, I am bowled over with excitement for the most part.  The common consensus appears to be that Mojca Erdman and Vitalij Kowaljow are the weakest links in the cast, and I would agree for the most part that this is the case.  Kowaljow's Commendatore is not poorly sung, per se, but rather his voice just sounds a bit young, and therefore it lacks the gravitas of a truly successful portrayal.  In the graveyard scene, one wants to feel the chill of death in a truly rumbling basso-profundo, but such is life.  Erdman interacts nicely with the Konstantin Wolff's Masetto, but her Zerlina is small-potatoes when one considers that the role has been recorded by Kathleen Battle, Graziella Scuitti, Mirella Freni and many other eminent sopranos.  Her voice is smallish and quite bright, which is not bad in and of itself, but the portrayal is monotone and a tad screechy.  I suspect I'd probably appreciate her voice more if I was seeing her live, but the recording brings out the fault-lines.  However, I am nit-picking, and taken in the context of a group effort, Kowaljow and Erdman aren't so terrible.Coming into the experience, I had the most trepidation about Rolando Villazon's Don Ottavio.  Even if the character is a bit of a wet blanket, he does have some of the most beautiful tenor arias in the standard repertoire, and I didn't think Villazon's Latin sound would fit the cool beauty of Mozart's vocal line.  I, and many others, I suspect, are spoiled by Luigi Alva's portrayal under Giulini (and plenty of others), but Villazon did surprise me.  I'm not sure I really love him as a Mozart singer, but his treatment of Ottavio's music, the long breaths, and his unique sound make him a surprisingly good choice in this recording of stand-out voices.The ravishing Diana Damrau and Joyce DiDonato sing the main ladies, Donna Anna and Donna Elvira, and I'm not sure there have been better women in the roles.  Hands down, the most beautifully sung performance of the roles still remains in the hands of Joan Sutherland and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf on the classic 1959 recording with Giulini, but Damrau and DiDonato are stage-animals in ways that the late Dames never were.  Damrau's lighter voice is as flexible as Dame Joan's, but certainly is smaller in size, and I think it provides her an advantage in negotiating the mad flights of coloratura in Donna Anna's music.  ""Or sai chi l'onore,"" is spine-tingling, and the decorations near the end of the aria are astounding.  I was especially touched by the vividness of Damrau's approach to Donna Anna's recits.For DiDonato's Elvira, I have no words to really describe the magic with any adequacy.  Donna Elvira, to me, seems like a hard role to cast: she is sad, and mad, and little crazy.  Her vocal writing hovers lower on the staff, and a case can be made for casting either a mezzo or a soprano.  Schwarkopf under Giulini and Te Kanawa under Sir Colin Davis fall into the soprano category, and their portrayals effectively highlight Elvira's personal tragedy, but they don't quite catch the anger and slightly unhinged feeling about her.  Agnes Baltsa, under von Karajan, is better suited to the angrier aspects of Elvira, but she sometimes sounded like Princess Eboli wandered in from the wrong opera, and Elvira came off as more harridan than wronged woman.  DiDonato's comfort in the higher passages and easy dips into the mezzo range give us a very happy compromise.  DiDonato is a consummate musician, and her attention to text, line, breath, and dramatic truth is staggering.  I challenge you to find a better ""Mi tradi.""And to the men!  Luca Pisaroni's Leporello is handsomely sung, and he is likely a splendid Don himself, but I find he brings something quite wonderful to Giovanni's second-in-command.  There is a degree of smarmy sympathy in the Catalogue Aria when most renditions just come off blunt and sarcastic, and I find this a refreshing change of pace.  Some find Ildebrando d'Archangelo's sound inappropriate for the suavity of the Don, but I am in love!  I like the smooth sensuality Eberhard Wachter, a lighter, brighter sound, but d'Archangelo's portrayal is downright sexy.  He is no coolly detached noble womanizer, but rather a sex-crazed libertine!  The Champagne Aria is a frenzy of boozy ecstasy, and the booming ""Viva la liberta"" in the act 1 finale oozes unbridled sex.  Do I think it's a conventionally noble portrayal?  No.  But, it is one of the most vivid Dons in a field of many competitors.  I doubt this is to everyone's taste, but it definitely gets me to sit up and listen.On the whole, I believe the positive aspects of this recording far out-weigh the minor negative ones.  It can sit comfortably next to the revered sets of the past and hold its own next to them.";03 7, 2013;A3HRDCLUE4O4AG;M. Hall;A Singers' Don Giovanni (4.5 stars);1362614400

It is produced in China and I just wonder if they are adhering to American production standards, it shouldn't smell like funky chemicals.  Also, it doesn't look like this picture, it's really thick from above the shoulders  but gets really think after that, like long Cindy Brady pigtails.  Luckily I ordered it through Amazon and I am going to send it back.

The issue I have is the top portion (torso).  It is really small and short. The portion that goes around the neck is not adjustable, and since it's so short, the breast portion sits above where the breast actually sit. Also, it has built in cups which are stiff and small. I have not decided if I am going to send this back or not. I am going to look into making the neck portion adjustable so that I can wear it comfortably.;06 20, 2013;A3HWKOPYSD3XGY;Phyllis;Short Torso;1371686400

;B008BVMUVW;[0, 1];5.0;"""Zombie-Kids"" by Julia Dweck is a laugh-a-minute parody of zombies, which goes a long way toward removing the 'horror' from zombies, presenting them as being quite fun. The text is one long humorous poem, which meshes well with the very engaging illustrations.I think a lot of adults will like this book, too, but it really is intended for kids. If you have (or know of) a child who is frightened by the idea of zombies, or perhaps has nightmares of a zombie hoard chasing him into a dead end alley, this book will completely change his perception of zombies. From this book, kids will learn to look upon zombies as being just normal people like them, rather than some hideous creature bent on eating their brains. (There are plenty of REAL things in life for them to fear; non-existent brain eating revived dead people shouldn't be causing them anxiety.)I think this book would be very well received by virtually all kids, and some of them may even carry it around the house with them all day, to stay close to their new zombie friends in the book! This is a great gift idea for ages 3 and up. Go check it out!";03 10, 2013;A1IVBDLAO9MP4A;Grampy;Zombies Just Want to Have Fun!;1362873600
;B008BVMUVW;[0, 1];5.0;Before reading this myself I allowed my 8-yr old and 5-yr old to read it themselves. They came back excited and talking about dogs burying spines and Zombie Butchers. In our family, that sounds like a pretty good story. So, with good expectations, we sat down to read it again together.And, I was not let down in the least. The text is simple enough that the 5-yr old could read much of it, but humorous enough that the older boy stayed interested as his brother read along. As soon as we finished, they both started discussing their favorite parts, with Zombie bowling taking home the big prize.Knowing that it can be difficult to find books to interest boys in reading, I can't recommend this enough. It has all the things most boys like, and even a little phlegm. The illustrations present the characters in an unassuming way that even an easily scared child should find safe and approachable. And, the story presents them in a sweet and friendly way. If Zombies are like these, who wouldn't want their own zombie friend.A great read.

Big Joe Roma Chair, Zebra;B008C3XZTK;[0, 0];4.0;"A note of advice before I begin a review of the bean bag chair:I ordered this through Galactic Deals, LLC. Though they state that sometimes they order items through another vendor, why not save yourself time and money and order it directly from Walmart for only $29. Plus you save yourself hassle if you need to return it...and you get a tracking number when you order it through Walmart (which you won't get when you order it through a third party).Now onto the review:PROS:Size. This is a good size for adults. It's about 2'X4'Fill: very well filled without being heavy. I can sit in it and not hit the floor and not land in any &#34;blank&#34; spots. No leakage either. Furthermore the bean filling in the back won't sag into a bunch at the bottom because separate compartments are sewn into the chair assuring beans are kept spread out.Sturdiness: Back isn't self-supported but when supported by a wall, it's sturdy.  Bottom stays put does't spread out from under you as you're sitting.CONS:A little to firm for my taste - but this is my subjective preference.No arm rest (but that's just me being spoiled I guess). With a lap desk it's moot anyway.The material is similar to canvas but easier to clean spills off of. Overall, the quality of material is very good, as well as the craftsmanship and filling. It's a good deal for the price.";07 14, 2014;A9WXZCBN7O20A;Amazon Member;Way Cheaper at Walmart;1405296000

;B008CJ1R5S;[1, 1];4.0;Messages from Henry is a sweet read for all ages. Ideally suited to older children and young adults, Henry and his cast of characters will sweep you off on an adventure you won't soon forget. Ms. Scarberry writes simply, yet beautifully reigning in her readers giving them a special treat. There's no reason why you shouldn't be reading this now ...;01 29, 2013;A2NL1P5RL9PVTM;"Clare Gage ""Suddenly Lost In Words""";Oh, Henry!;1359417600
;B008CJ1R5S;[2, 2];5.0;I'm not a pigeon lover, but I sure loved this story. Growing up on a farm in Iowa, the pigeons I encountered were pests. But this wonderful story, which employed a rock pigeon carrying messages from a kidnap victim, hooks the reader into a magical mystery. The writing is dazzling. Characters were carefully drawn out and plot lines were turned and twisted like delicious, red licorice Twizzlers. Don't think it's just for youngsters, either. This author sketches out identifiable and realistic characters and scenes that create a fine diversion for both young adult and adult readers. Get it. You'll love that darn bird, Henry. And don't miss the author's new children book JUMPER.I bought both and sure enjoyed them.Dean SchechingerAuthor of Dinosaurs Are Hiding At The Zoo;08 8, 2013;A2NQAL3OCR48SF;Dean Schechinger;This Bird In Hand Is Priceless (and Cheap-Cheap at 99 cents);1375920000

;B008F9L7BY;[1, 1];5.0;Another great story in this excellent mystery series! I have read literally thousands of horse and pony books in my time and review many every year, so it is not lightly that I would place this series in the top 10 horsy series in print at the moment.Unlike some so called horsy mysteries or adventures where the ponies seem to fade into the background as the young adventurers set off looking for clues and other excitements, in these books the equine characters remain at the forefront. Not only because the mysteries themselves are related to horses, but because each book also deals with a particular horse-themed problem which the girls must face. Nerves, out-growing beloved ponies, bonding with difficult horses - these are just a few of the issues explored and give the books that extra depth. What I love the most about these books however is that despite having lots of excitement and mysteries to solve, the relationship between the girls and their horses is always at the heart of the stories.A fab series for young and young at heart horse lovers! Really looking forward to the next book in the series which is out soon...You can read the full review on the ponymadbooklovers website and blog.;04 9, 2013;A3B8TE9ZSH82IK;Ponymadbooklovers;Must feature in the top 10 of horsy series being written at the moment!;1365465600

I didn't use the new case back, I followed the advise of another poster, and used just the protective cover that came w/the Seidio BD2-HR5SSGS3-BK Extended Case & Holster Combo for the S3 (Fits Innocell 3500mAhBatteries). By doing this w/the 4200mAh Extended Battery, and a used foam ear plug between the battery and the protective cover this keeps everything nice and tight. It makes it so that you can use the protective cover, & the holster, but not the case back. However, if you use the Innocell 3500mAh Extended Life Battery, you can use both their new case back & the protective cover and they will both fit into the holster.

This series of books simply is not that good.

Since 'Hot Fuss', while their music has been good they never stepped up above the greatest of their first release...until now.I have no clear understanding as to why there is dislike to 'Battle Born'. The Killers have never sounded this raw and wonderful. Brandon Flowers' vocals have improved so much. He has to ability to channel so many great vocalist such as Mark Knopfler (From Here On Out), Freddy Mercury (Battleborn) and Bono (Heart of A Girl). The songs themselves are so beautiful with a perfect mixing of new wave and rock n' Roll. Each and every song on this album is an amazing listen that fills you with different emotions and just gives you goosebumps all over.I don't know where this band is heading, but what I can take from this album is there have been some great releases this year, but 'Battleborn' may in fact be the best one to date. Also, the deluxe edition was not as good as expected.

3x Canon EOS 650D Rebel T4i Kiss X6i DSLR camera Premium Clear LCD Screen Protector Cover Guard Shield Protective Film Kit (3 Pieces);B008I94B50;[4, 4];5.0;"As with any product like this, the most important thing is to TAKE YOUR TIME.  Make sure you clean the camera screen well - you don't want to see any particles, dust, or nose grease on it before you apply this.The peel-off order is clearly labeled 1-2.  When applying, the best place to do it is in a steamy bathroom (i.e., after a shower) to minimize dust in the air.  I peel off about 1/2 of the #1 side (sticky side), keeping it face down so dust doesn't land on it, and line up the uncovered end with the camera's screen.  No need to press it down, it should adhere cleanly and quickly.  Slowly remove the rest of the #1 peel-off, and watch for bubbles before laying it down completely.  If you have any bubbles due to dust, carefully lift the protector and use a piece of scotch tape to remove the dust from the sticky side of the protector - don't use your finger!  After it's adhered to the screen, gently pull off the #2 film, being careful not to lift the entire protector off the screen.  Press out any air bubbles with your thumb by &#34;sweeping&#34; them to the edges, and you're done!The fit of the protector is very precise - there is MAYBE 0.5-1mm at one end of the screen that isn't covered - to me, that's an excellent fit.Obviously, it's not going to protect the screen from a heavy impact, but it seems sturdy enough to avoid scratches from normal use.  And you get 3 of them!Would recommend!";04 11, 2013;A391Q31801T2JI;KB;Great fit, simple application!;1365638400

Nitecore SENS Mini LED Flashlight w/ Active Dimming, Black, 170 Lumens, Uses NITECORE-SENS-MINI;B008J4EMVM;[2, 2];5.0;"The Nitecore SENS Mini can hide in the palm of my hand with an inch to spare, yet it puts out 170 lumens of brightness with one CR2** battery, and usable output to more than 75 yards. The SENS Mini has a built-in sensor that detects the angle the flashlight is tilted at, in order to set the brightness level. Pointed straight up at turn-on time, the SENS Mini will go into Active Dimming mode, so that it constantly monitors the carry angle and adjusts the brightness accordingly. To set a fixed brightness (170, 50, or 20 lumens), just turn the flashlight on when pointed level, 45 degrees down, or 90 degrees down. In the 2 dimmer modes (50 and 20 lumens) the &#34;Soft Turn-on&#34; feature is activated, so if you require instant on, use the brightest (170 lumen) mode.**Most LED flashlights I've had use the CR123 lithium cell, or standard AA and AAA batteries. The SENS Mini uses the CR2, similar to the CR123 but smaller. The CR2 isn't easy to find at a good price, but so far I've been able to buy the Duracell 6-packs for about $15 USD.The SENS Mini is a really great light and well-made of strong aluminum, with 3/8 inch of knurling near the head and 5/8 inch on the rear of the barrel. There is no tailcap or mode switch (on/off operation is described above), and it will tail-stand even with a lanyard attached. The head turns easily enough for one-handed operation (although it's clumsy), but if the threads aren't lubricated at the recommended intervals, it could become difficult to turn with one hand. I've had a few CR123 1-cell lights that burn through the standard Surefire batteries pretty quickly, but so far the SENS Mini is giving decent runtime with the CR2 Duracells, although I haven't measured it. Highly recommended!";01 22, 2014;A3SL0HA6422W4M;Dale Thorn;Nitecore SENS Mini 170 Lumens LED Flashlight review by Dale;1390348800

It's cushy, so it seems like it would protect the iPad against a fall, but there's no cover for it, so the screen is always exposed. Even though I have a screen protector, this makes me a little uneasy. And it's so bulky that putting it in a carrying case would prevent me from being able to carry it in my purse on road trips. I don't think this case is bad, I think there just isn't a case out there that I want - something slim that is also very protective. So I'll settle for this.;11 16, 2012;A3LPFKI2BVCBP;Amazon Customer;It's okay;1353024000

The grilling surfaces are easily removable and easily cleaned, however, I do not think that they get hot enough to do a good cooking job.We tried this grill several times, using the same chicken and small steaks that we make successfully on old grill and the results were uniformly very poor on this one.  Our previous grill seared the surface of chicken or steak, which kept the meat cooked on it very juicy and tasty.  This grill did NOT sear the surface of the meat that we tried it on, and the result was dry and rather unpalatable.  There is no cooking temperature setting (or even an on/off switch), so trying to heat the surface more by heating it for a longer time only resulted in making the chicken and beef completely inedible.  Too short a time left the food undercooked.  We are returning the grill and going back to our old one.This is an inexpensive grill and unfortunately acted accordingly.  It might be marginally acceptable if price is an overriding consideration and if you like dry chicken and steak, hence two-stars instead on only one.  Hamilton Beach also makes a more expensive model with different cooking temperatures and this one might get food hot enough.  My advice is to only try the grill being reviewed here if you can take it back and perhaps to try the more expensive, but perhaps better model.;12 11, 2013;A1KJO5VP4K3CHU;Peter J.;Cleans up easily, but I did not like how it grilled;1386720000

Even if you don't have a sweat problem it adds more comfort to your grip. You don't have to grip the controller as tight because the silicone is not as slick as the hard plastic controller case.You will have to &#34;break&#34; this product in when you first start using it but after the third or fourth use you will notice a marked improvement. I suggest that after you put this on your controller, BEFORE you start playing, rub the surface down with your hands to get the residue off and your natural hand oils on it, then &#34;use&#34; it like you normally would for a little bit and then you will be ready to play.I put mine on and immediately started playing and thought I bought a bad product but I gave it some time and of course some sweat and noticed after a couple of hours gaming that the controller was easier to hold.

Earloop Procedure Masks, Blue, Box of 50, 3 ply, (Light and Soft) (FDA, CE, ASTM Level I, EN14683 Type I) (99% BFE, 99% PFE);B008K8PWOS;[0, 0];3.0;"I purchased these to use while riding my bike around the city, which I do every day, as that is my main form of transportation. Besides having issues with pollen and mold, I found I was getting a stuffy nose and scratchy throat, likely to breathing in all the city dirt and vehicle exhaust fumes, not to mention unwanted swallowing of the occasional bug (ugh!).I have used these for several weeks now and find that the masks really help with those issues, and I like that they also reduce the sun exposure to my face. It can be a little tricky to wear the mask while riding, because it does get hot, and it sometimes creates steam/fog in my glasses. I usually have sunglasses on during the day, and I wear clear white goggles at night to protect my eyes from the dirt/smog as well. When I get the fog effect, I just lower them to just below my nose while still covering my mouth.It works just fine for the intended purpose, but as others have pointed out, there is a chemical odor, and I have to wonder what the heck I'm breathing into my lungs and if I'm not trading one pollution problem for another. After a very long ride, I find that the long ingestion of the chemicals seems to alter my sense of smell for several hours, and I'm frequently walking around the house trying to figure out &#34;what's that weird smell,&#34; when nobody else smells anything weird but me. Sometimes I will use my Neti pot after a long ride, or go in the steam room and sauna at the Y, and that seems to help clear things up a bit, but that's not always an option.I will continue to use these until I can find a similar mask that does not have an odor. I suppose I could just tie a piece of cloth around my face and accomplish the same thing, but I love that these are disposable, and I love the lightweight comfort of them and the elastic earbands, which are not as easy to recreate in a jerry-rigged cloth version. I don't necessarily need the virus protection - just dust and dirt - so after experiencing these, I will be looking for something similar that is chemical-free and simply protects against dust and dirt.I do find the mask comfortable, except for the heat-inducing part. I haven't used them with the intention of any type of virus protection, so I can't speak to that.

Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7-Inch Student Edition (White);B008KWRTH2;[74, 75];4.0;I bought this on 8-19-2012 , so my ownership period has just been a day, but I have to say this tablet is very refined.The Nexus 7 definitely is better performance wise, but it lacks the features this tablet has. The Tab 2 has the expandable port which can easily increase the 8GB to 40GB's. The main reason I bought this tablet over the Nexus 7 is the ability to control your Television with it. The Peele television app is AMAZING if you figure out how to use it. It shows you everything that is on, and all you have to do is click on the picture , and the remote will take you to the channel showing it. I am using it as my main remote in my living room, I have the tab sitting on the coffee table as my main entertainment controlling device.Performance wise, it could be better. If you DO NOT upgrade the operating system, then the tablet performs amazingly fast, but after updating the operating system I did notice a difference in performance, screens are now very very slightly choppy as you switch between them. Most people probably won't be able to notice, but I can.If the tablet would have came with an HDMI out port I would have given this tablet 5 stars. I was looking for a tablet that I could stream Netflix to my TV with and with the IR blaster to control my televisions, I could not find a good one so I settled on this Galaxy Tab 2. I am very happy with my purchase.Conclusion:If you want pure performance then pick the Nexus 7.If you want features and versatility then chose the Galaxy Tab 2 7.;08 20, 2012;A25I0HCJHVNL2B;elazor;Good 7 Inch Tablet;1345420800
Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7-Inch Student Edition (White);B008KWRTH2;[1, 7];2.0;"This is a nice small tablet for the money.  It is inexpensive, and it includes a little (but worthless) keyboard.  I bought this model because it was much less expensive than the mid-tier full-sized tablets, but there are real tradeoffs.First, the device itself.  It's a 7 inch tablet, which I equate more to a huge smartphone (in contrast to a small tablet).  The smaller screen doesn't give a full desktop-like browsing experience - instead, it gives a giant handset-like web browsing experience.  I would have enjoyed the bigger real estate of a full sized tablet, but a decent bigger tablet is more than twice the price.  But on a budget, this is adequate for the kids.The device looks great.  It is light weight and easy to hold in my hands.  I wouldn't call it ""robust"", but it seems like it will stand up to most normal use.  I don't think it will survive any kind of drop - the back is flimsy plastic (it looks like metal in pictures - don't be fooled.)I don't know how well it holds a charge - we keep it plugged in a lot of the time.  It charges in its keyboard dock, or via the iPod-like USB cable. The device charges with a dock connector that looks exactly like a dock connector of an iPod, but beware - don't let your kid force an iPod USB cable into the Galaxy, or vice-versa, because Samsung designed their dock connector to be just a tiny bit different.  ""Visually very similar but completely incompatible"" is a very stupid design.This is the ""student edition"", but your kid likely will never use it to study - don't be tricked into thinking that this could be a laptop replacement.  The included keyboard is junk.  Some of the keys on my keyboard don't work - it is probably included in the package because it is very cheap and has no real value.In all, would I buy it again?  Yes!  It is a usable but inexpensive tablet.  It isn't all that it wants to be, and it is far from perfect, but I don't know of a better low-end tablet out there for the money.";09 16, 2012;A364Q9FMC2YHGQ;Lance J;A good small tablet, with shortcomings;1347753600

;B008LW7DQ8;[0, 1];5.0;"I first bought this book as a paperback, but then I decided to purchase the updated version on Kindle and I'm glad I did. The reason I wanted to read this book was due to the Christopher Dorner case in Los Angeles in early 2013. The best way to describe this book is riveting. Quite an eye opener for anyone who lives in the city of angels.  It is interesting to find out what a complete paranoid, controlling, power hungry cop Darrell Gates truly was as chief of police, although in fairness, he was the end of a long corrupt line of LAPD chiefs (excluding Tom Reddin). Today, I can see improvements to the LAPD management hierarchy and police procedures that were made in the aftermath of the Rodney King incident, but they still have a long way to go. One hopes that once some of the ""Gates type cops"" (who served under him) finally retire it will improve further. I think, to a lesser degree, it still remains a special club dedicated to protecting their own no matter what. I would suggest anyone interested in this book, buy it on Kindle.

iRobot Roomba 650 Vacuum Cleaning Robot for Pets;B008LX6OC6;[1, 1];1.0;I love my Roomba and it's a must if you have hardwood floors in your house.  I purchased this 650 off of Amazon 15 months ago for approximately $450.00.  Well, today it died.  I called customer service and they confirmed it's dead and my warranty was expired.I was put on hold for 5 minutes (probably assuming I'd hang up)  and finally came back to offer me a free replacement.  They send me a refurbished model w no warranty and I pay for return shipping to send the dead one back.  I was thrilled and am pleased with their customer service, but long story short, I expect a $500 novelty item to last longer than 15 months.No abuse, no no water, all hardwood home, ran daily.Love it but damn..... .15 months.

ZOOT SPORTS Men's Performance Tri 6-Inch Short;B008LYDK18;[1, 1];5.0;I hate normal bike shorts. They make me feel like I crapped a pillow. These are perfect for biking. They have a nice faux-fleece chamois that wicks moisture away like crazy and provides the perfect amount of padding for anyone with a convex butt. I wear them solo, and they look fantastic. I wear them with shorts on top, and they feel amazing. Zoot is a great company, and this is the short that you want. I have an older version of their shorts with leg grippers. This short doesn't have leg grippers, but it doesn't ride up because of Zoot's crazy technology. I'm telling you--it's the bomb.;10 30, 2013;A3KM49YN5C09U8;Curtis Loew;Amazing bike shorts.

3.5mm Cute Crystal Panda Anti Dust Earphone Plug Stopper for Iphone 4 4s HTC;B008M19R6W;[7, 7];4.0;"This product came about a week early from the expected date and in excellent condition. It's super cute! The panda is about an inch or so high, but it kind of dangles down the back of the Galaxy S3 and gets in the way of the camera. This means you have to move/remove it to take pictures. The back of the charm has hearts cut into the metal, which I don't think it shown in the pictures, but they are kind of wonky just like the eyes.All said, it's adorable but not very high quality.My main problem was that after taking it out and putting it back in the jack a couple times, the clear stub didn't want to retain its shape and it started to fall out; which is why, after a month, I am now looking for a new charm...Would be a MUCH better product if the piece that actually goes into the phone were made a more durable material than rubber.

Jane Iredale Glow Time Full Coverage Mineral Cream Concealer BB 3, 1.7 Ounce;B008MAU8XY;[0, 0];5.0;This is the only foundation I use. Note that you need only a TEENY bit - less than the size of a BB - to pat over your face. If you have problem spots to cover, you can pat on a little more there. It provides all-day even coverage for my 58-year old skin. Note that I had full laser resurfacing a year ago, and my surgeon's dermatologist recommended this as I was healing. It did a great job then and continues to do a great job on my lovely, glowing skin a year later. In very hot weather or for more formal occasions, I dust on a little Jane Iredale loose mineral powder to set the cream. If applied lightly and layered as necessary over trouble spots, it looks very natural even in bright sun.;03 27, 2014;AXWN2GZOT3I0F;"Bette O ""avid reader""";My ONLY Foundation;1395878400

;B008MF3X9K;[0, 0];5.0;First, like the thing says, this does not fit the Fire HD. I have both models and so go backward, designed for the HD and fitting the older version, but you never find one for the regular fire fitting a newer model.I love the duct tape make of these covers. They have a solid feel and a sheer to them which adds to the look of the case, giving it this rough duct tape look that is rough in looks only. I was quite surprised to find, once handled, that it felt quite nice. The green color is exceptionally bright as well, setting it off, making it really eye-catching. It has a pocket inside too for a few small sheets of paper or something else pretty flat.The case is thick, a lot more than you would think looking at the thing, which is always great because you cannot have too much protection. combine that with the way the outside is designed and you have a pretty hard shell without the feel. The inside is, of course, soft and protects the Kindle that way.The mounting is basic, with thicker straps, doing the job pretty well. I always check mine a few times a week, just to make sure they're holding, and this has done great. I always fear them falling out, so this is really appreciated.If buying a cover, make sure to shop around for design as well as function. You might prefer a different make, not an issue with the item at all.;02 1, 2013;A96JD9312DHWC;"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""";Duct Tape;1359676800

Capriclear Natural Soothing Oil, 1.9 Fluid Ounce;B008MI0F7K;[0, 0];5.0;With only one ingredient - 100% fractionated coconut oil (Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride) - which is the purest form of coconut oil available - the product avoids many compounds that cause skin reactions and/or possible harmful long term affects. It is hypoallergenic, odorless and colorless. The spray is easy to apply and although initially seems a bit oily on contact, give it a moment while it is absorbed into the skin. It is not greasy or sticky but it does leave a sheen on the skin that can appear slightly greasy.I used it in on some patches of dry, irritated skin (mild eczema) and it was soothing and moisturizing. It worked well after a shower to lightly spray on the body to seal in moisture. It is a small bottle but a little goes a long way. And, like products our great, great, great grandparents used, I appreciate the fact that it does more than one job. On the box it states the spray is good for scars, dry/sensitive skin, hair, nails, cuticles and stretch marks. The product has a seal of approval from the National Eczema Association.Testing its other uses, I tried the product as a substitute for an after blow dry smoothing cream to see if it would tame some slightly frizzy spots without weighing down my hair. I sprayed a small amount on my hands, rubbed them together to distribute the oil and then moved my hands over just the areas that needed a bit of smoothing. It worked well -- as well as the smoothing creams I normally use. And, I also was happy with its performance as a cuticle moisturizer.I purchased the product in a national chain drug store, and it cost considerably more there than here. With moisturizing products, if given a choice, I prefer to use ones with as few chemicals and preservatives as possible. Note that the product does not have an expiration date, only a date of manufacture.;05 21, 2014;A35Q0RBM3YNQNF;M. Hill;CapriClear Coconut Oil Spray;1400630400

Oreck RAIRP-B Professional Air Purifier, X-Large, Black;B008N7GV4Q;[0, 0];5.0;The Oreck patented Truman Cell technology in these air cleaners is awesome.  Be that as it may, an awful lot of non-OCD consumers will probably find cleaning it more of a hassle than it needs to be.  A hairdryer with a strong blower (and a no-heat setting), used outside your home cleans it quickly and effectively.  My own favorite method is a leaf blower.  Don't waste your time with a vacuum or the available spray, although a can of dust-off might also work (because the cell itself is pretty small).  A vacuum works fine on the passive filter elements, however.The trend in air cleaners seems to be to use a UV-C germicidal lamp to disinfect particulates, but this is likely not a solution that will work if you are, like my wife, a chronic asthma-sufferer, any more than you would take anti-allergy medication for something in your eye (although my mom might actually try that!).  I won't buy one of those.

General Imaging PJ205 ipico Handheld LED Personal Projector for Apple iPhone/iPod Touch - Retail Packaging - White;B008OPTQ76;[8, 10];4.0;I like this item.  You can project an image or movie from your iPod or iPhone onto a wall or ceiling, either for your own viewing pleasure or to share it with others.  I found it was easier to project a movie on the ceiling while lying in bed than to hold the iPod up for 2 hours in your hand to watch it, so it does give you convenient options for viewing.  On the other hand, to get a nice, clear, vibrant picture you don't want to project it too far away from you because the color gets diluted otherwise.  That means that ideally you would be projecting it on an object right in front of you or on a low-hung ceiling.  If image quality is not important, then you'll find a lot more situations where you can use it.  Like any projected image, the farther away you get from the surface you're projecting it on, the lighter the colors and the harder it is to see.;10 26, 2012;A3UVGHUDOY77YR;MissPammy;This is cool!;1351209600

After about 4 weeks of taking it, I began to notice that my ability to problem solve went way up.  I was standing in front of some tools, and 5 ways to use each just tumbled out. I had to pause and breathe, I was so thrilled.I am a migraine sufferer, so the genetic testing for the MTHFR missing gene was something they did looking for answers.  Now this L-Methylfolate does nothing for pain, but it has cleared up my thinking immensely.

Ikea Hemnes Queen Bed Frame Black-brown Wood;B008QDI0YG;[2, 4];5.0;This is a great bed. But I agree - buy it at Ikea, much cheaper at $199! The assembly directions were very easy to follow, though it did take us almost 3 hours to put together. I don't hurry, though - I make sure it's done right the first time. That time included sorting all the hardware into separate containers first, which I highly recommend. We were also assembling it in a very small room, which takes a little more time to maneuver large pieces without damage. The bed is holding a 210 pound man and a 120 pound woman just fine. It seems sturdy enough to hold quite a bit more. It's very pretty and stylish. I think it's a great bargain and I'm very happy with the quality.

;B008QVUGTK;[1, 1];5.0;The second offering in the Blackstone & Brenwen series Swansong for a Sibling by Andrew D. Mellusco does not in any way disappoint. With much improved editing and writing the second book is a joy to read.Once again all our favorite characters are back in all their glory and not so glorious forms, ready to do business as advocates for those who may or may not be as innocent as we have been lead to believe. Punch has been accused of Battery and Judy is testifiying for the prosecution. A swan has shown up where none should be and isn't all that she seems. Fury is dating someone she works with (no I'm not going to tell you who... you have to read it) and things are going along a bit faster than their co-workers are expecting.Yes, all is well at Balckstone & Brenwen, the usual chaos exists but in such a wonderful way that no one is complaining. Even the office supplies are in a state of Zen until Aladin shows up.

;B008RL18SM;[0, 0];5.0;I have several different brands. The one I most prefer is Exceed's Walkera V2. It is the same as the Walkera Ladybird V2 except it has a racier canopy. The two I mentioned are not geared  and swing smaller props and I should mention they are quite a bit smaller. The V929 on the other hand is larger and more visible in flight. The important thing about all three of these they can take quite a beating. I expected to break a bunch of props and haven't yet. If you want to learn how to fly a quad copter any one of these should be satisfactory. It is important that once you plug the battery in that you place it on a level surface until it calibrates itself. I intend to install a FPV system on the V929 since it should be able to carry the additional weight easier and it is physically larger so mounting the equipment shouldn't be as challenging. If a child is going to operate the copter he/she should be supervised and explained the potential hazards which can occur. The worst scenario I can think of is a child being struck in the eye. The LIPO batteries are indeed tiny but there is a lot of energy stored in them when they are charged. I have been flying electric for over 30 years and have never had a fire involving batteries until the other day. I was pushing the little single cell pack into the housing of one of my quads when the wires shorted out a fire ensued. I got it outside and let it burn itself out which meant the entire plastic housing was gone. They also produce a great deal of smoke. I would recommend the V929 if for no other reason than that the way the battery is designed with a plastic end cap and that it also slides into the battery holder relatively easy that it is probably a safer battery than you will find on the other copters. Comparing quad copters to helicopters I believe that the quads are generally easier to fly because the yaw rates are lower. If you are like me and have some time flying model planes you may find yourself challenged at first but the learning curve is pretty steep. I hope to build some quads this year and flying these little ones provided me with more incentive.;04 23, 2013;A15JF218QIUVTK;Roy E. Oetting;Learning how to operate a quad copter;1366675200

Not worth the $199 I paid for it.Note:  Based on the measurements, I had also hoped I could use it to carry my 11-inch MacBook Air, and/or use it for work documents and files, but it's not big enough for those either.  That's too bad, but it doesn't factor into my rating -- I should have measured better.;03 14, 2014;A3LFXWL0SUTXEP;Discerning shopper;Nice-looking, but quality doesn't justify the price;1394755200

;B008S87SC4;[10, 10];5.0;"Throughout my years of collecting SACDs, one unfortunate constant has been the disappointing audio quality of the LSO recordings. I'm extremely happy to report though, that this new disc combining Faur&eacute;'s Requiem with a melange of Bach pieces is the exception to the rule. Actually, more than just that, the expansive sound given to conductor Nigel Short and his choral group Tenebrae, aided here by the London Symphony Orchestra Chamber Ensemble and assorted soloists, is not far from some of the best I have auditioned.In the past, some have blamed the dry acoustics of the Barbican Hall for the parade of LSO sonic disasters. While that may very well be part of the problem, others, like myself, also point the finger at careless microphone placement, being that the same recording crew has also managed to mangle the fine acoustics of the Marinnsky theater. As I wrote in a review ofStravinsky: Oedipus Rex / Les Noces, ""... the poor musicians are virtually powerless against the flat and recessed recording, engineered by Classic Sound. There is no depth whatsoever to the stereo soundstage and the diffuse focus robs the singers of whatever musical impact they might be trying to achieve...""It's important to notice though that this specific program was captured live at the Church of St. Giles in London, which bathes the musicians in just the right amount of reverberation, enough to enhance but not to muddle the solemn nature of the music. And in spite of the deep and wide soundstage, there's no loss of precision in the placement of every musician, whether one of the soloists or members of the ensemble. Quite the opposite, the recording is so detailed that one can easily distinguish individual voices within the choir. But most importantly, even during the organ and brass climaxes in the Requiem, there's an astonishing degree of transparency, truly worthy of the often used ""being there"" clich&eacute;.In terms of the program, the juxtaposition of Bach's second partita for solo violin with some of his vocal chorales feels more innovative than truly compelling, although the contrast between the faster violin lines against the ethereal choir is rather interesting, specially towards the end when they play together. And while the violin part is beautifully performed by Gordan Nikolitch, it sounds small and lonely by itself. The truth is that I couldn't help but to think that something in the vein of Poulenc's Stabat Mater would make a more apt companion to the Requiem, which is after all, the true star of the show. Still, I can only hope for this not to be the single exception to the rule, and instead, the first of many more of the same from the LSO.";02 1, 2013;A2T2NT6Q6YKF88;Arnaldo;Exception to the rule;1359676800

;B008T4TEQU;[0, 0];4.0;The extended review can be found on The Review Board: [...]Disclaimer: May Contain Slight SpoilersThe story starts off with two couples. Both of them get pictures taken of them while posing in front of a statue called El Beso (The Kiss). Although a brief meeting, it leaves quite an impact on both couples.Dialogue between Rita and Tom sets the stage.  It was Tom's inner thoughts, not Rita's admiration for Simeon's looks, which really peaked my interest.  The chance encounter becomes significant when Rick is called upon to take a case involving embezzlement of company funds. His client is none other than Tom, the gentleman he met near The Kiss.In the past, Rick has been the pillar of doing the right thing, yet Tom's case causes Rick to blur his normally defined lines.The author does a great job in really bringing the reader in based on dialogue along due to the innuendos. She also has a clear cut way in how she wants to use the conflict of each of the characters as well as excellent pacing with the drama.I did notice as I read this copy of The Kiss, there were no quotation marks anywhere in the work to separate dialogue from narrative. This did make it difficult in quite a few parts to follow. In addition, in some places, there wasn't a clear breakdown of which character was saying what. It would help from a visual standpoint if the quotation marks were present.  (I do recognize in different parts of the world that single quotation marks are used, as opposed to double quotation marks for dialogue.)It would have also been nice to have italics to point out the inner dialogue and thoughts of some of the characters as well, like Tom's thoughts on Rick in the beginning or when Tom and Rick meet with each other for the case.Despite these suggestions, I highly recommend The Kiss for its wonderfully complex characters, interesting plot, and great pacing in action.;10 3, 2013;A2W8PK154LUQ8H;No Labels;Unexpected Thrills of The Kiss;1380758400

NiteRider Lumina 650 Light;B008VFBJ6A;[0, 0];5.0;I bought the 650 because 1) it didn't have a powersupply and 2) another user said he wished he got the 650 instead of the 500 for 40 bucks more.  I don't regret it but I ride on the road every night and even on the lowest setting I'm afraid I'm blinding people.  If I'm approaching a pedestrian I usually point it down to my front tire.  Other times if I'm sitting at a light I'll put my hand over it or point it down.  It's just really bright.  Don't confuse my meaning though.  I'm pretty sure I'd have been hit by now if I didn't have a light this powerful.  When cars get too close or it's 'drunk' hours I put this bad boy on full blast and it's brighter than most car headlights (when cars pass me my light is brighter than theirs).  It also pans left and right.  When I'm on the road i usually angle it a little to the left so approaching traffic see the light in the lane.  I've been stuck in heavy rain twice and have not had an issue.  I also use it when camping because it's the best flashlight I've ever owned.  I would buy two more if I had the case.  Totally worth the price for the upgrade.;04 20, 2013;A2LGIDW9MRH37O;Rick;Really bright;1366416000

He wakes up still, but only once a night and usually LATE, maybe 3 am, and stays in our bed and SLEEPS.

Dog Pets White Plush Red Faux Suede Christmas Boots Warm Shoes Size 3;B008X16KY8;[1, 1];5.0;My little baby unfortunately hurt the padding of his paws and found walking to be difficult, he actually does like the shoes but the shoes keep his feet well protected and it's allowing me to put healing creams on his padding and he doesn't ingest it.

Even when he's not thirsty, he will walk around the house holding his cup with a huge smile on his face.  If you buy the cleaning kit and use hot water, it cleans up very easily.  Be sure to hold the valve end under the hot water while squeezing the hose at the other end to get all the milk/water/juice out.  The extra work has been worth it.

The Tablet stopped working correctly. 4 days after Amazon's return policy. I hope they can help me out. The menu keeps flashing on the screen constantly.let me start with the Pros. Very sturdy. Seem that it is a solid design. After a few updates the tablet perform better than average compared to many others I've wasted my money on. Screen resolution was way better then I had imagined. The processor is average but at 1.2 ghz you really can't expect much. Now for the Cons. The description says 4gb with expandable memory up to 32 gb which is true.. to a point. The expandable memory is only good for if you want to put movies or songs on it. If you want to add or put apps on it, No Good. It shows a external memory but it is actually an internal memory which is only 1.8gb,  can't get many apps on that. I emailed the seller here's the response:  Please check the content on the sd card by clicking ""file manager"" on the home screen. You  can see all the contents on your tablet from different SD card or internal storage spaces.When you plug in your SD card into the slot, the tablet will recognize the sd card, the sd card icon will be shown on the bottom corner of the screen.When you connect your tablet to a PC using the USB connections, you will see the SD card as a separate drive (see below).  You can copy files direct to the SD Card using your file manager.On your tablet PC, you will find the data on the SD card at /mnt/external1 (the last digit is the number one).The Gallery app will automatically see any photos or videos on the SD card.You may need to go into the Setup of other apps to add the directory to the list of locations scanned.A great free file manager, which can see the SD card data is File Manager HD (Honeycomb).  This app will let you move files from the internal storage to the SD Card directly on the tablet without connecting to a PC.Other memory card related stuff:You can leave the memory card in the tablet at all times, it doesn't need to be removed.To remove and or change the memory, the safest method it to first go to Setup, select Storage, then Unmount the SD card.  This way, you will be assured that nothing is using the memory card at the time you remove it.  When you insert a card again, it automatically is mounted.TabletExpressNo answer to why I can't move apps to my sd card that I installed. File manager will not allow you to move apps to the installed sd card. And don't try to use it as a ereader it will use all your internal memory.";11 16, 2012;A1U219ARDY0US1;Jose;Good but not Great;1353024000

Equally important in my installation, they dim smoothly and evenly. However, as they dim, they maintain their color, whereas the halogens become yellower. Also, at the dimmer's low end, the LEDs still emit a little light, whereas the halogens go dark despite the small amount of power still running through them. So, they are not a perfect match; but overall, in addition to their greater energy efficiency and cooler operation, I like these LEDs better than the halogens they are replacing.

Good Sense Acetaminophen Pain Reliever/Fever Reducer 500 mg Geltabs, 50-count;B008Y5UJFY;[0, 0];5.0;Works as well as other generics or store brands. Most likely works as well as real Tylenol. I rarely buy branded products anymore when it comes to otc meds. It can be expensive in a family of 5 with  allergy and pain ailments so often. I feel like these work perfectly well though. I noticed relief within about 15-20 minutes which is pretty normal for me whether I am using branded otc or store brand. The price is definitely appealing as well. Buying these on the Subscribe and Save program makes them cheaper than the K Mart brand I had been buying. If you don't mind generics or are looking to try some in order to save a few bucks, give these a try. I have tried a few different otc meds from Good Sense now and they all have worked great so far. No complaints with any of them. Seems to be a high quality generic.;11 22, 2013;A1QBOC76MIOJYP;MyPenName;Good Sense Great Price;1385078400

After a couple of weeks of reading reviews, looking over MANY other holsters, & a little extra wait time (just to see ifn the price might decrease~it usually does!) So needless to say I bought it, had a little mix up w/ the shipping...none to worry though, they got it to me straight away! Once I received the holster, I was immediately IMPRESSED! Nice thick holster, very pliable yet VERY STURDY! I left my Taurus in the holster for two (2) days w/o touching it. For the next couple of days, maybe six or seven (6 or 7) times per day I would lift my weapon half way out of the holster & then push it back down into the holster kind of like a &#34;wear in process.&#34;Now, my weapon & it's &#34;glove like fit&#34; holster are my new American Express...I NEVER leave home without it...(them!)Thanks for reading my review, I Sincerely hope that it helps you!Yours in FREEDOM...Norseman";08 15, 2013;A2Y1FS6FBXXWBE;"NavyDoc ""STOTTZY""";Like a glove!;1376524800

Bluecell Slim Flat 6 feet USB Data/Sync Cable for Apple iPhone 4 4S 3GS iPod Touch New iPad (Green);B0090B8TSU;[0, 0];3.0;I guess it's my own fault for assuming that the cord would work for any iPad (I have a 1st Gen).  It doesn't.  It does work for my iPhone 4s, but I'm disappointed that it can't be used for both.  Other than that--if you're buying it just for an iPhone--I have no big complaints.  A minor complaint would be that because it's a stiff tape-like cord, it's little harder to wrap up and keep condensed than the typical round cords.  It wants to be stay stretched out.  And since I was planning on using it inside of an electronics caddy (that keeps the cords coiled and out of sight) I had to use a Velcro tie to keep it coiled up.  For use next to a bed or on a desk, it probably would be fine.Final word: It's cute, but I wouldn't buy one again.;08 1, 2013;AY9SSM2CJ5RTA;A. Thompson;Does NOT work with iPad 1;1375315200

OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 (Discontinued by Manufacturer) ( Not for iPhone 5C) Retail Packaging Bolt - Grey;B0090YGJ4I;[1, 1];2.0;I am rough on phones and bought this case because it seemed to do the best job at protecting my iphone. It at least doubled the size of my new iphone 5- my husbands seems sooo tiny compared to mine- but it was worth it to not have to replace the screen. It does do a good job of protecting my phone.I had been using my old dock with the iphone5 adapter until it stopped working and I picked up an ihome dock/radio. I was super excited to go home and use it until I realized my stupid, giant otterbox doesn't fit on this, or any other, dock. I read the fine print on another otterbox listing and saw that this case is not made to be dockable... This is a huge oversight- who doesn't dock their phone? I wish I had realized this giant problem it last week before it was too late to return it. I guess I'll be buying a new case and throwing this one in a drawer. Maybe I'll go on a trip sometime when I won't want to dock my phone...DON'T BUY THIS CASE IF YOU EVER PLAN ON USING A DOCK!!;08 27, 2013;A2DH9ZKS65SC7N;Allie;CANNOT BE DOCKED;1377561600

OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 (Discontinued by Manufacturer) ( Not for iPhone 5C) Retail Packaging Bolt - Grey;B0090YGJ4I;[0, 0];5.0;Less than a month of having my iPhone 5, while getting my son into the car, I left my phone on the roof of the car because I didn't have pockets (I was dressed up to go out for my birthday), well, a few minutes later I realized much to my horror that I had left it on the top of the car and I made my hubby turn around and go back to find it. So, we spot it, on the middle of a 4 lane road, there were tire tracks on it, but not a single scratch to my phone at all. The Otterbox didn't crack, there was tire tread marks on the silicone part, that went from the bottom to the top, over the screen of my phone. NO DAMAGE. I will forever be an Otterbox girl. It saved my phone, and saved me $500. It survived being thrown from a speeding car, and being run over, while I didn't chose to do it, I am so glad that I had it in the Otterbox, just in case. While it seems like a pretty big expense to spend extra money on an already expensive phone... I will never use any one other case.;01 5, 2013;AHR41XN4WFZJ5;"Amazon Customer ""Back by Popular Demand""";This case saved my iPhone 5's life.;1357344000

OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 (Discontinued by Manufacturer) ( Not for iPhone 5C) Retail Packaging Bolt - Grey;B0090YGJ4I;[0, 0];5.0;I had an OtterBox (a hand me down from a friend) for my last iPhone, so when I got a 5 there was no question what case I would get. This one is even slimmer and seems tougher than the last one. The protective plastic over the glass screen is  a bit thinner (I think) than the last one, but still works well.  The flap over the power port seems stronger, which is good since the last one ripped towards the end of it's life w me. I work on the production end of the music business, so it's important toprotect my phone/lifeline. The other day I left the phone in the wrong place and then accidentally dropped a road case lid on it! The phone flipped and landed on the floor. The rubber cover is unscathed, and the plastic case sustained a couple dings, but that's it. Pretty impressive for a metal to plastic impact!

OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 (Discontinued by Manufacturer) ( Not for iPhone 5C) Retail Packaging Bolt - Grey;B0090YGJ4I;[0, 0];4.0;I bought this case after I dropped my iPhone and broke the screen.  This happened while I was holding my kid following taking some pictures of them playing (better to drop the iPhone than the kid).  After replacing my phone, I bought this knowing that I would likely be stuck in the same predicament in the future.  Since then, of course, I have dropped the phone in the same manner, and didn't have to think twice about which one to hold tightly onto.  The phone has dropped multiple times and is doing great.  My one downside is that it is quite bulky (this is the only reason why I dropped a star in it's rating- otherwise it is great), however, it has NOT stopped me from putting it in my pocket.  Also, I like how the screen cover protects my phone from when I put keys ( or my kids put a rock ) in my pocket (both are true stories).A couple of points about this case:-It has a hard shell that goes around the phone (burnt orange/reddish), and this is then covered by a rubber (grey) cover.-The screen cover is nice- no interference with the touch function-The ear speaker is open.  This allows some dust to get in under the screen.  Therefore, it occasionally needs to to be taken apart for cleaning.-This case is not waterproof.-The bottom and side covers for the headphone jack, the adapter and the volume button are a little difficult to open- especially for people that don't have long finger nails.  Opening it is doable.  It does loosen up over time.;07 2, 2014;A3097CWWQIZCC5;JayC1;Protects from Bumps and Drops;1404259200

OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 (Discontinued by Manufacturer) ( Not for iPhone 5C) Retail Packaging Bolt - Grey;B0090YGJ4I;[0, 0];1.0;I purchased this case for Christmas and within 10 days, my screen has cracked. I reviewed the otterbox and found this one to be rated highly even though it's bulky. I had the case in my pocket, was walking up a few wooden stairs, and my phone falls out of my pocket (due to the bulkiness of the case). The phone lands on it's back and I don't even flinch because I know I have the case. Unfortunately, my screen is now cracked and spidering. I'm afraid to take the case off and damage it more.

OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5 (Discontinued by Manufacturer) ( Not for iPhone 5C) Retail Packaging Bolt - Grey;B0090YGJ4I;[0, 0];3.0;"As far as I'm concerned, the Otterbox Defender, Griffin Survivor, and Lunatik Taktik are the best, ultra-protective cases on the market.  That being said, I ordered this particular case by accident.  I was looking for a &#34;defender&#34; for my iPhone 5S to replace the somewhat extra-bulky Taktik, got &#34;dizzy&#34; from the multitude of choices, and ultimately ended up buying the wrong case.  This case is as marked - for the iPhone 5, not the 5S with the Touch-ID fingerprint sensor.  It was entirely my own mistake, and online return was quick, easy, and painless.  Way to go, Amazon!I have since discovered the Tech21 Impact cases with D3O material.  Go YouTube some video drop-tests or look up the D3O material demonstrations.  The Tech21 Impact provides very nearly the same level of protection from bumps and drops as the Otterbox, but at a fraction of the size and less cost.  But, there is no integrated screen protector with the Tech21, so if that's important to you, stick with the Otterbox.  On the other hand, there are some really nice screen protectors out there - the oleophobic glass ones are particularly nice and very affordable.";01 21, 2014;A2ZR86VINKXV7J;John;Great case, but not for me;1390262400

I wish I had it before the crack, but it hasn't gotten worse and has been great in protecting it. Some covers make it hard to charge your phone, but this is perfect.

Lint and dust easily get under the screen protector of this case.  The only way to remove the lint and dust is to remove the case and clean the screen protector with a mild solvent or compressed air.  With that being said it is not the easiest case to take apart.  Overall though this minor drawback should not deter you from this purchase.  One other thing I liked is buying it from Amazon.  The Verizon store tried to rip me off for 50 dollars for the same case.  I saved 20 dollars by buying it here.  I would highly recommend this product.;04 2, 2013;A2FD6XJ7ABG9FG;Steve D;OtterBox Defender Series Case for iPhone 5;1364860800

Eagle Cell SCIPHONE5S05 Barely There Slim and Soft Skin Case for iPhone 5 - Retail Packaging - Purple;B0091LF49Q;[0, 0];4.0;When I first got the case, the seams were a little sharp to the touch. I've had/used the case for several months now and the rough/sharp edges have worn down and no longer exist. The grip is still sticky and makes one hand gripping easy. I've also dropped the phone several  times from 3-5 feet onto concrete/pavement (getting in and out of my vehicle) without damage.Pro's:Low costGreat gripEasy slip on and off for ihome usersno issues with over-sized headphone plugs (I use Sony MDR 7506's)Protects the phone from drops.The raised edge that protects the screen is nice. You don't have to worry about scratches when putting the phone down screen first on flat surfaces.Con's:The case is thinner and much looser than previous silicone cases I've owned.Dropping it in or retrieving it from the back pocket can sometimes twist the case offthe two edges along the bottom of the phone are the flimsiest partSuper long shipping from Asia.The silicone is softer so it collects a lot of visible dust. that's hard to clean off.I would recommend the case to anyone that can deal with the cons. They are all items I don't really even think about anymore but for the sake of objectivity they are certainly worth mentioning. Oh and I can't stand hard cases because I tend to take the case on and off at least twice a day and hard cases can sometimes be a pain. So if you're in the market for a cheap flexible case, this is a pretty good buy.;05 23, 2013;A3CEKJBBIB69PQ;Patrick;Does the job;1369267200

At first there was nothing striking about this ebook, but as I began to read, I could almost sense the authenticity and sincerity in the author's writing voice. I've been a Christian man a long time, and after the death of my father, my faith was challenged. However, it is little things like this that come into my life that make me believe we all can truly connect to our home through prayer. This ebook helped to reenforce for me a few things:* The humility of Christ as it relates to prayer, ""Approach as a child"".* The respect we should have when praying, not only for the results that are sure to follow, but for the one we are speaking to with our hearts.* The courage to face prayer from the positions we are ultimately meant to occupy.I thank you for writing this sir.

;B009369Z8A;[34, 37];4.0;I won't paraphrase the storyline as others have done here so well.  I will add that the momentI hit play on the BD Player, I was so engrosed in the film I realized I was still sittingon the edge of my seat after the first 20 minutes before I made myself comfortable, and never once hit pause.I was riveted by Tom Hardy's acting, his portrayal was an original. It did not rely on a particular accent, clothing, make-up, mental defect or resemblance to a historical figure. He created an intelligent backwoods bootlegger, who despite his profession and its violence, lived by a code so strong that he appeared invincible. The glimpses of his tenderness he allowed himself were profoundly felt.  The film was satisfying in its cinematography, cast, and story.;12 4, 2012;A1PB5AU5WZB2LS;The Lone Angler;FLAWLESS is Hardy's Performance;1354579200
;B009369Z8A;[0, 0];3.0;"A crime drama ""Lawless"" (2012) has everything that would make a great picture: talented players, moody photography, nice soundtrack music, etc. The only thing it doesn't have is a screenplay, one of the most neglected departments in making a movie.Set in the Depression-era Virginia, ""Lawless"" chronicles the lives of the Bondurant brothers - Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke) and Jack Bondurant (Shia LaBeouf), running a moonshine business in Franklin County. With the arrival of corrupt Special Deputy Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce), their business becomes more difficult, but the brothers will not give in to pressure to bribe.Unlike Australian-born director John Hillcoat's previous work, a dark, post-apocalyptic tale ""The Road,"" ""Lawless"" attempts to be a serious artistic work that also entertains. The result is a mixed bag. While the visuals are always attractive, the film does not know where it really wants to go, with flat characters whose fates we do not care much. The romantic subplot involving Mia Wasikowska's characters is forgettable. Jack Bondurant's transformation is not really convincing.""Lawless"" is just another example of how a story based on real-life figures could have been better. (And if you are a Gary Oldman fan like me, remember that his role is a small one, though he does a perfect job.)";07 17, 2013;ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T;Tsuyoshi;"Depression-era Crime Drama (Set in Virginia) from the Director of ""The Road""";1374019200

Diane Von Furstenberg Luggage Modern Tile 4 Piece Luggage Set, Orange, One Size;B00943T564;[0, 0];4.0;Bought these from several different sources because the set was no longer available here in orange. I have the 24 inch upright, the 20 inch upright, the 20 inch wheeled city bag, the 19 inch shoulder bag and a solid orange large DVF 28 inch expandable upright spinner (the largest). I got all the pieces so that I can have options for different types and lengths of trips. The spin wheels are on on all the pieces except the wheeled city bag (not pictured here). The 28 inch that I have is appropriate for check in. As I said earlier, my 28 inch is solid orange but still DVF brand so it matches the other pieces. The dimensions for the solid suitcase (mine)are 19x28x10.5 and 11.5 pounds. The dimensions for the one pictured here are 11x 28x19 inches and 13.2 pounds. Major carriers like Delta specify a maximum of 62 inches so these should be well under the requirement at about 57 inches or so. The 20 inch roll aboard is smaller than my previous roll aboard so should be able to fit easily into the overhead bins on a 747. They have a 10 year guarantee on them which sounds about right to me since I had my other set for over 10 years. I have read lots of reviews that say they need to be scotch guarded so I will be doing that before I use them. They are good quality. I think they're gorgeous. I love the color which to me is like a tangerine and I'm looking forward to stylishly cruising through the airport on my next trip. Lots of people must have liked these pieces so the sets are either very expensive or hard to find.

;B0094AH3MU;[1, 1];4.0;"Verdi's 11th opera should have been a rousing success. It was commissioned for a London opening, Queen Victoria was in attendance, a good cast had been obtained with super-star Jenny Lind as Amalia and Verdi himself was to conduct a quite competent orchestra at Her Majesty's Theatre 22 July 1847. The music he wrote was an advance over his former works such as the absence of the obligate opening chorus and the concertato finale. Here the main character Carlo and the chorus set the scene and start the drama in high gear. Queen Victoria was displeased, the audience loved Miss Lind but not the opera. Back in Italy the work received scant attention. It was considered shocking, terrifying; depicting men who as the Robber chorus says like ""stealing, killing, whoring and fighting"". Just the sort of vivid action plot Verdi would favor for most of his career and successfully. But what went wrong with I Masnadieri? The problem seems to lie in the play that was the opera's source.Frederich Schiller is considered one of Germany's most significant man of letters, up there with his close friend and colleague Johann von Goethe. As a reaction to the literary age of enlightenment, the German era of Romanticism was being ushered in by these two and others. The younger Schiller's first work was ""Die Rauber"" cast as a ""Sturm und Drang"" (Storm and Stress) play depicting a terrifying picture of society. It is a rage against oppresive society that deprives the individual his right to make his life as he wishes and to think as he wishes. (The Count dismisses his elder son Carlo who then takes up with other suppressed rejects of nobility-run society) The problem is Schiller went too far. His individualism ended in fanatic idealism as he was wont to do in other of his works used by Verdi; Don Carlo, Kabale und Liebe (Luisa Miller), Giovanna D'arco and even Maria Stuarde of Donizetti and William Tell of Rossini. But in the later works Schiller handled it better. In this Schiller's first work some of the dramaturgy is not well handled. The taking of his own life by the younger brother Francesco in the last act is convenient but not motivated sufficiently. Just as the killing of Amalia by Carlo is simply nihilist and awkward. (Budden in his work on Verdi says she was not supposed to be killed).The music as a whole is good solid Verdi. At places it is quite beautiful and foreshadows things to come. Some arias are quite spectacular in character devlopment. The stage production is a mess; total Eurotrash. Ignore it. The singers are excellent. The young Venezuelan soprano Lucrecia Garcia sings beautifully and is skilled in this demanding role. Aquiles Machado is also an excellent singer and did well in his long role. Both need to mature and stop looking at the director all the time and especially when they are making love to each other. She needs to lose weight and needs some vocal refining. All the other roles were well done. Nicola Luisotti had the orchestra, chorus and singers under tight control and all played very well. It all sounded so good but...... there's that cluttered mess on stage. Oh well, put the disc on to play and go dust the furniture.";05 2, 2013;A3PQJ6J7FOOWFG;"Dr. John W.

;B0094WK9EC;[1, 2];3.0;"This is a review of the Deluxe version, I have not listened to the regular version.  Also, I only own the Deluxe version of Until One, and have not heard the regular version. Until One Deluxe is a 5 star release, it is imaginative and for its time, pretty revolutionary (something not easily accomplished with this type of music).  It is a journey and it is probably the best DJ mix Ive heard since the heyday of Paul Oakenfold.  This Deluxe version however, is not worth the money.  It is a mix mash of songs, some of them re-imagined from Until One, and many of them new.  The problem is, that if not for John Martins amazingly complex and beautiful vocal style and lyrics, the songs are typical of contemporary pop songs ala Rihanna.  If you are tired of the typical disco love song by a female vocal, you are going to hear this album and think ""Ugh, not more of this again"".  However like I mention, the John Martin tracks are phenomenal, and I am excitedly awaiting his own album, which, regardless of what style he uses- his voice is amazing.";01 4, 2013;A3J5RR5YZ44DFQ;my alias;John Martin saves this album, and the genre as a whole.;1357257600

JBL Micro II Ultra-Portable Multimedia Speaker (Black);B0096T7TQE;[3, 4];5.0;"Really?  That rich bass sound came out of that little speaker?  Wow!  I use this plugged into my Kindle Fire for watching movies and I can't believe the sound that this little speaker puts out.  To my ear, it's 10 times better than the KF's built-in speakers, and really makes my movie watching experience so much better.  Plus it's small enough that I can just plug it in and stand it right beside my KF.PROS & CONS AT A GLANCE:+ Compact. With a diameter of about 3.5 inches, it doesn't take up much room either beside my KF or in my bag.+ Rechargeable battery (USB charging cable included) that seems to have a pretty good life--at least a couple of movies.+ Large, accessible push button ON/OFF switch. I have another 'different brand' small speaker and the small power button is not easy to use.+ Physical volume control. I love not having to rely on my KF's 'on screen' volume controls.+ Generous 12"" cord (from unit to tip of plug) that winds around the base of the speaker and clips in place for neat, tangle-free storage. I also love the fact that the cord is orange!  (The rubber foot is also orange.)+ Gold 3.5mm plug, compatible with any device with a 3.5mm headphone jack.+ Built in 'loop' for attaching it to your bag/clothing, perhaps with a carabiner clip? I just stood it next to my KF.+ Drawstring carry/storage case included.  It conveniently fits the cable and the speaker. It would have been nice to have the JBL branding on the case, too.- The cable doesn't quite wind around the base for me. Another half inch in length would have been better.- Can only be charged via USB. This isn't an issue for me, but could be for some.- User manual leaves a bit to be desired.  Admittedly, there's not much to know, but I found the manual unhelpful.OVERALL:This is a great sounding little speaker.  It's not the cheapest on the market, but I think you're getting what you pay for with the JBL name and quality.  I found the rich-sounding bass provided a very satisfying movie listening experience on my Kindle Fire.";02 26, 2013;A20DDH4NT6Q1E8;Koala1356;Little speaker, Huge sound!;1361836800
JBL Micro II Ultra-Portable Multimedia Speaker (Black);B0096T7TQE;[3, 4];5.0;When I unboxed my JBL Micro ll Ultra-Portable speaker, I was surprised at how small it was. It's like the size of a pancake (or two stacked on top of each other). The plug fits into a spot underneath, making it even easier to carry, and it comes with a simple soft black carrying bag.I tried the speaker out with my iPod Nano, and when I first plugged it in... it didn't work. Not sure what the problem was, but it was super quiet, and I was afraid the unit was defective. But then voila, the sound came on beautifully bright and clear.I am so pleasantly surprised at how awesome the sound out of this tiny thing is. I have a cheap portable speaker that's not much smaller than this one, and the sound is pretty bad at loud volumes. I also have a GoGroove speaker twice the size that has decent sound quality but doesn't get loud enough. The JBL speaker goes loud enough to listen to while I'm in the shower, and that's not even at the loudest setting. The volume control slides real smoothly, and makes for good, fine adjustments. Loud and sounding oh so pretty.The power button is small and smooth as well. I suppose there is the danger of pressing it by accident while in transit, I'll have to watch out for that, but I like how easy it is to turn on and off.Guess what: USB rechargeable batteries! And possibilities to daisy-chain!I am loving this speaker. Plus, the cord is orange.Update May'13:I took this speaker with me on a trip. The power button was pressed in transit, but the battery was still going. It lasts a long time! Also, I love that this speaker is loud enough I can use it to listen to music while driving with the window down. However, it's not quite loud enough to triumph over a room of 20+ at-play elementary-school students.;03 4, 2013;A3GFK7F5IUF60X;"Myra Schjelderup ""Ignolopi""";WOW -- Super sound, and loud enough!;1362355200

Citizen Quartz Chronograph 35mm Swarovski Crystal Women's Watch - FA1040-51A;B0096TQZY6;[5, 5];5.0;I bought this watch for myself after spending a lot of time researching watches. I wanted something simple enough to wear every day, without a lot of glitz. It also needed to function well, be easy to read with a quick glance and be able to stand up to some moderate abuse that comes with my job. This watch hits all the marks. I did need to have a couple links removed in order for it to fit properly, but that is to be expected with any watch. The chronograph functions are wonderful and do not distract from being able to read the time, which I have encountered with some other watches. It holds up well to the occasional abuse that my job can put it through. On top of all that, it is lovely to look at and I get many compliments on it.

The individual is now an exemplary voice bringing unbelievable interpretive skills to music befitting of an artisit who has matured and who is willing to share his musical &#34;wisdom&#34; upon us. The CD opens with THE definitive version of Leonard Cohen's &#34;Tower of Song.&#34; There are no hysterics, needless melismas (far too prevalent with today's younger, less matured singers) and a depth of reading even the composer could not reveal.

Zooka Wireless Speaker for iPad and Bluetooth Devices (Red);B009AS900Y;[0, 0];2.0;I like the looks of this speaker, but the performance is not great. The sound does not fill my room, it is OK, but not cristal clear, battery does not last very long, buttons are hard to the touch. The wifi makes a loud sound when connecting to Bluetooth. The sound comes from the sides and so obviously it is louder from the sides if you are facing the speaker, so I have to place the speaker sideways. I liked the hidden stick that helps the speaker stay in place.

JBL Micro Wireless Ultra-Portable Speaker with Built-In Bass Port and Wireless Bluetooth Connectivity (Black);B009AYLDSU;[0, 0];5.0;"Whoa!  Extremely surprised at the power of this tiny thing.  The bass is deeper than I expected.  Louder than I expected.  The mid range is clear and not scratchy as are the trebles.  I'm no audiophile, so take this review with a grain of salt, but all I have to say is WOW!Plus it's simple to use and I do love the dial type volume control instead of a rocker or button type.  The beeps when linking and unlinking are not annoying as some had mentioned.  The LED flashes red when the battery gets low, and solid red when charging.  After the battery is charged, the red LED shuts down.June 18, 2014 Follow-up.  I wish I can give it six stars.  I can't get over how good this 3.5""X 1.5"" speaker is.

It folds fine for landscape, but does nothing for vertical unless you want to stand it straight up.  In that position, I end up laying it down flat.  I also like that I can clip my stylus at the binding and although it throws the closure off a bit, the magnetic closure still catches well.

Secrid mini wallet leather vintage brown, Very Slim Credit Card Wallet / with RFID protection, with one click all cards slide out gradually;B009BUBF9K;[0, 0];3.0;Very small wallet and only holds 4-5 cards in the RFID protected area, almost no room for bills.  This is great for someone who dosn't keep a lot of receipts or cash but only uses credit cards but not as useful otherwise.  It is very cool when you can flip out the cards and pick one when paying the bill and the aluminum case provides superior protection compared to the RFID blocking paper sleeves and other leather RFID blocking wallets on the market just wish it was a real billfold with a place to keep the receipts and bills which I have to fold up twice to fit in the money compartment and then often have trouble closing afterwards.  Great idea guys but just a little too small even if your not like George Costanza from Seinfeld.

BC Footwear Women's At Large Gladiator Sandal;B009CF3JB6;[3, 3];5.0;These look great and are very comfortable, The fit is true to size, they are light, and unlike other similar sandals I have, the leather straps don't chafe my feet even after walking in them for hours. I have only had them for a week, however after getting caught in a rainstorm and walking through puddles I thought they'd look a little beat up, but they were back to looking brand new as soon as they dried.

CND Shellac Intro Pack;B009CZVVRA;[7, 11];4.0;I recently had my nails with the shellac system and paid  $40.00 for it.

When I removed the polish myself I couldn't believe how beautiful my nails looked. Needless to say I bought this starter set and am doing my own nails at home. I also purchased the uv gel light for $52.00. Ladies all I have to say is it has already paid itself off. I work in retail and always killed my polish,but NO MORE!  So worth it!

Sealy Waterproof Crib Mattress Pad, 2-Pack;B009DI43MG;[1, 1];5.0;"The mattress pads have an excellent, snug fit.  We are the grandparents and our daughter was using a crib sheet without the pad at her house.  She claims the baby sleeps better at our house (ha ha!) so we gave her the extra one.

In addition, I knew there would always be a barrier between the baby and the pad.  I washed them before first use and they have an excellent, snug fit over the mattress and under the sheet.

Gronomics GBO1Q Cedar Garden Bed Oil, 1-Quart;B009EQF7D6;[0, 0];3.0;We have several cedar planting beds near our back yard deck.  We live in a harsh climate so we're already accustomed to treating all of our outdoor wood as well as taking care when purchasing so that what we get will survive our long cold winters and hot muggy summers.This product is a more natural choice, and although it has a VERY strong odor like many other products of this type, it is intended for outdoor use and the odor decreases.  We preferred this to petroleum-based products, and kept it in a safe location as it is flammable.We plan tomatoes in our beds so we wanted something that is safe to apply to the wood.  It has UV protection and over time will keep the wood from drying and cracking.If you've ever bought something from Wilson's Leather, you know that they will always try to sell you Wilson's leather conditioner that costs about $15.  However, you can get the same type of product for 1/3 that price.  This oil is made for the Gronomincs cedar beds, but it's not quite the same deal as Wilson's.  Although you do have a high price point to this cedar garden bed oil, it is the only 'natural' oil we found.  So you have to decide if, like everything else out there that is 'natural' or 'healthy', you want to pay more.\;12 26, 2013;A2WW57XX2UVLM6;Talvi;Good for protecting your investment;1388016000

Vest - V-TAC Bravo-ACU-2XL/3XL;B009G5Y6ZA;[0, 0];5.0;"First off...  if you're looking for a Load Bearing Vest that will allow you to play a support role and fire more paint than you can possibly imagine...look no further. Press the ADD TO CART BUTTON.... now. Got that part done? Good. You're on your way to tactical play at it's finest.I would usually set out some ""Pro's"" and ""Cons"" here.... but there are only MINOR MINOR MINOR cons... so it doesn't warrant a list, so let me just tell you about this fantastic piece of tactical deliciousness.This vest is VERY well made (as expected at this price point and from V-Tac). It is durable, comfortable, cool wearing and allows for a TON of gearing set ups utilizing the MOLLE system. It has 10 (yes, not a typo, I said TEN... thats 1140 rounds... half a case... a S*** TON of paint) pod carrier pouches on it that are excellent. They fit the pods snug and don't allow any fall out. There are MOLLE fasteners in the back for attaching a tank pouch, as well as all over the vertical shoulder straps that could easily handle map/id pouches, Grenade pouches, radio pouches, utility pouches, pistol magazine pouches, 12oz CO2 ouches or, in my case... 4 more 140 round pod pouches (hey, I'm a Broadsword... I support and provide ammo for my team... give me a break).Wearability in UNMATCHED by anything I've ever owned in this price range. It carries the load comfortable by putting all of the weight squarely across the shoulders. The webbed backing does a SUPERB job of keeping you cool while operating, even in the extreme 100+ degree lower Alabama weather.As far as cons... here are mine...The pod holders grip TIGHT. Seems like a good idea until you are trying to yank one from a pouch for a teammate while under heavy OpFor fire. Hopefully, over time, these will break in and not be a huge issue.No metal D ring on the shoulder so I can secure my sling off of my actual neck. It's always good to let the vest take the weight of your weapon as you carry all day... can't do that without a metal D Ring. But, this was easily fixed with 49 cents and a trip to Lowe's... viola'! Sling attached to D Ring attached to a Molle point on the shoulder. God I love this vest.That's all I can say negative.... and that's not really negative. So, since I KNOW you clicked ""Add to Cart"" earlier when I told you to, all you have to do now is sit back and wait on this to arrive. You can thank me later. I accept gifts of cash, or I wear a size Z06 in Corvette.";04 17, 2014;A1IQPWVQ0YTVJK;Ken Younce;Everything a player could EVER need in a LBV!;1397692800

Tuliv Migraine Defense for the Prevention of Migraines;B009GMJJZU;[7, 7];5.0;"I had my first migraine when I was twelve. In the 58 years since that moment I have not been free of full blown migraines for more than two months at a time. That was the best I could do until I started taking Tuliv Migraine Defense, recommended to me by a fellow migraine sufferer. Before using this Tuliv product, I had used Ergotamine Tartrate, Fiorinal, and more recently Midrin at the onset of a migraine. I found the Midrin most effective in reducing and limiting migraine symptoms. In November of 2012 I started taking Tuliv Migraine Defense, along with 5HTP, twice daily.  The last migraine I experienced was November 20 of 2012; it is now July 14, 2013. That is the longest period in my life, since the age of twelve, that I have not had a migraine. So, do I like Tuliv Migraine Defense. Yes, I do. A lot. When I first started using Tuliv Migraine Defense and 5HTP, I was already taking Life Extension 100mg CoQ10 &#34;with enhanced mitochondrial support,&#34; B vitamin complex, and Magnesium Citrate. I continue with those, also twice daily, and if I do not have time to take all of my usual supplements, I take these three supplements with the Tuliv and 5HTP. I suspect, but am not sure, that these three items contribute to the avoidance of migraines, but since migraines did not cease until I started with the Tuliv and 5HTP, I do believe the Tuliv Migraine Defense and 5HTP are the reasons I have not experienced a migraine for so many months.";07 14, 2013;A1RU31D84Z12SN;Jim;Migraine Defense Works for Lifelong Migraine Sufferer;1373760000

;B009K54CPU;[1, 1];2.0;"Elijah asks Holly out on a date during their sophomore year of high school. When her parents find out, they force Holly to break the date and give her a flimsy excuse. While stewing in her anger, she discovers she can levitate objects (including herself) with her mind. Her parents walk in on the levitating and suddenly she's in a doctor's office being told she has a terrible disease that gives her delusions. To stave off the symptoms, she must take medication for the rest of her life. Elijah discovers that very that night that he has the same disease, and must take medication to prevent his delusions of being a mind reader. Seven years later, when the pharmacy runs out of the medicine, Elijah becomes so desperate for more that he kidnaps Holly and drives all night to the source. Once there, they figure out that they don't actually have a disease, they have real powers.Holly was an interesting character, a bit unusual in the new adult genre. She was a showgirl, and perfectly comfortable parading on stage in a spangled bikini. She was smart and determined and (gasp!) a virgin. (Why is that always supposed to be such a shocker?) She had a nice relationship with her parents, they were a tight family who spent a lot of time together. Elijah was close to his mother, with no father in the picture. Considering they lived in Vegas and worked in a casino, they were pretty average kids.Their parents, however, were awful people. They knew their children had these powers, and instead of teaching them how to be responsible with them, they scared them into thinking they had a horrible scary disease, then drugged them. In fact, a lot of the adults were real jerks. The old ""We're doing it to protect the kids"" excuse didn't cut it.There were a lot of little bits that bothered me. Like how Elijah and Holly just accepted their diagnoses with no question. I don't know about you, but when I get the tiniest little symptom, I'm on WebMD checking to make sure I don't have the bubonic plague. But they never did the first Google search. Even 7 years later, they still took those pills without question. Speaking of their pills - the name of the miracle drug was Mentafixol. As in ""Mental Fix All."" How cheesy is that? Also (highlight the text to view the spoiler), Holly and Elijah were practically in love, then within a few short minutes, they were threatening real violence to each other. Holly's best friend betrayed her and she was okay with that? And not to be too picky, but ""the sex is beyond belief"" is quite the exaggeration. There's 1 sex scene total, and it's not all that spectacular. There was definite chemistry, but nothing I would consider super sexy.And this was probably the thing that bugged me the most - Holly spent at least 3 quarters of the book in her showgirl outfit - a sparkly sequined bikini and heels. That's all. She walked around Vegas in it, rode a mass transit bus in it, slept in it overnight, then continued to wear it while walking around another town. Never once did she suggest stopping at a WalMart to pick up some shorts, or that she might be uncomfortable or underdressed. That just smacked of improbability.There were also a few unanswered questions (I really dislike those). For example, one scene clearly described how someone used their keys to open a slot machine specifically to touch the metal inside while exerting their powers. But why they had to that was never explained. I can only assume that the metal helped to conduct powers...?That was a lot of nitpicking, so let me mention some of the things that I liked about the book. It was very zippy and the plot sped along, so I was never bored. The writing was very descriptive and I enjoyed the dialogue. I loved how strong Holly was, she was confident and friendly. The chemistry between her and Elijah was great, lots of sexual tension and longing looks.Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to overcome my issues with the book. Near the end, in the middle of the climactic final scenes, I literally found myself thinking ""I really should care about what's happening."" But I didn't. I honestly didn't care how the book ended, but by then there was less than a chapter left, so I figured I'd just finish it.I didn't connect with any of the characters and had only a mild interest in what happened to them. On the plus side, it was a quick and entertaining read.";06 27, 2013;AD3BGP54JCK0H;Andrea @ The Busy Bibliophile;I just couldn't get into the book.;1372291200
;B009K54CPU;[0, 0];4.0;With the seediness of Vegas as a backdrop, Holly and Elijah's story connects, separates, and then collides again as they learn about the conspiracies that have kept them in the dark and kept them apart.  The story was well paced and paced full of romance and a lot of mystery.  The idea that natural abilities are behind the magic acts in Vegas was a great idea and I loved the way it served as the foundation for the conspiracy theory that pushed Elijah and Holly back together.I liked the contrast between Holly and Elijah.  Holly is more brash and used to being on stage.  Elijah is quiet, reserved, and not sure who he is even before his talents present themselves.  I also liked Kaylee and Shane who were really interesting supporting characters.  There are no guarantees between Holly and Elijah since Holly's abilities and Elijah's power might not be a good match, but the heat is definitely there between them.  I always appreciate a complicated relationship and this story had it in spades.  Levitating Las Vegas was a departure for Jennifer Echols, but it was a really fun combination of a traditional Las Vegas Mob story and paranormal romance.;06 13, 2013;A2NJL67GOMVDU0;"K.

Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch) 2012 Model;B009LL9VDG;[0, 0];4.0;I liked it but was unable to get the cloud storage. I contacted the chrome ninja and despite my saying this was a new device, I received a cryptic reply that it was not a new device and did not qualify for the 100gb storage. BAD SERVICE!!!! I will update if they fix it. Update: cloud storage issue is fixed but it took a few emails. I researched the device but never saw that bluetooth was for mouse and keyboard only, not for headsets. A workaround could be a bluetooth transmitter into the headset jack, but it is a disappointment and likely won't work without a lag for videos. The screen isn't great but ok for the price. The device still is worth having with the fast internet and applications and no virus issues.;06 15, 2013;AI57OQ89IH6IF;;I like it, it has limitations, can't use bluetooth headset;1371254400

I mainly use my laptop at home and on the road to surf the internet, check email, social networking.  I rarely use any computer programs, so I really don't need Windows.When I received the Chromebook, I was very surprised for the price how well built is was, the screen quality, and how easy it is to use.  It reminded me how Apple products use to be.  They make saving anything you need onto Google Drive (which is in the cloud) super easy.  Then you can pull up anything you save on your phone or any other computer.  The computer is very fast, the key board is top quality, it is very light, and I have never had a computer turn on so fast.If you are a light computer user who mainly uses the internet, this is definitely 1000% a great value for the money.

Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch) 2012 Model;B009LL9VDG;[0, 0];3.0;This laptop is $249 and it does what it advertises. That is, one can browse the internet and use Chrome browser apps which are pretty limiting.Being that it has an ARM processor, I wish there was a way to install Android on it and run it off of the same Linux kernel so one can switch back and forth between the two without having to restart. One can install a version of Ubuntu with XFCE so I would think installing Android would be pretty easy, yet no one has been able to do it I guess. In addition to the full desktop browsing and Google services offered by Chrome OS, Android would provide access to so many apps that are not available on Windows nor Chrome OS. Those apps would be natively supported on this processor. That would make this laptop super useful and I would pay another $150 for it even without touch support.Installing Ubuntu for ARM helps, but one's still limited by what has been complied to run on this kind of processor.Not being able to put Android on it may not be a legitimate complaint for most people. I could just imagine not needing anything else for everyday use if that were possible.;09 6, 2013;A3HQFF558YMJ9Y;;Decent Laptop for Internet browsing;1378425600

I LOVE it! My Chrome home page and all of my Google stuff from my PC and everything loaded on them is automatically right there on my Chromebook too!

Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch) 2012 Model;B009LL9VDG;[1, 4];2.0;"I am a tech guy and wanted to warn about a design flaw with this Chromebook.  With less than six months of use, my screen started having blue and black lines appear around the edges and spreading towards the middle.  I could eliminate the lines and regain a clear picture by adjusting the tilt of the screen (close a little/open a little).  However, after a while, I could only gain a clear picture if the laptop was almost closed.WARNINGS:  (1) If you do not know how to remove a laptop screen bezel, search for &#34;How to replace a laptop screen&#34; on youtube.com (CNET has a good video).  (2) You should never work on a laptop without powering it down.  If you make one little mistake, you will have a paperweight. (3) There are many people suffering with this identical issue.Understanding that a screen replacement was probably not going to work, coupled with the fact the device was all but useless, I decided to take it apart.  I first removed the bezel and checked the connections.  The screen did not change and remained constantly streaked with blue and black lines.  I then removed the bottom (there are visible screws as well as hidden screws under the sticky pads.  Once all screws have been removed, you must work the back apart much like the screen bezel.Once I had the bottom off, I found the issue in less than a minute.  There are several wires running from the motherboard to the screen.  One is a bundle of wires in a mesh sleeve and the other is a single black wire.  The issue is with the single black wire.  It has a sheathing; however, it is too short and stops prior to protecting the wire from being pinched between the wire bundle and the hinge plate.  To repair, I carefully unthreaded the black wire (leaving it connected) and wrapped the wire with a small piece of duct tape.  Yes, duct tape.  I couldn't find my electrical tape and since the sole purpose was to prevent the wire from being pinched, it worked.If you are thinking of purchasing this item, don't!  If you have already purchased and are experiencing this issue, here's your fix.  The fix is difficult; however, I enjoy working in such conditions.I would NOT recommend this product";05 28, 2014;A198IKGZ9MSO4C;;ISSUE WITH SAMSUNG CHROMEBOOK 303c SCREEN!;1401235200

Don't expect Mac Air quality.  This chromebook is plastic and keyboard is not ideal for typing.

I'm also concerned about the paint/finish of the computer.  Likely will wear out and scratch easy.As for Amazon, I wish I could give them a rating.  I requested a second replacement computer since the first one delivered had a nick in the case.  The second one was delivered quickly and in good faith.  Unfortunately,  the second one had a bad keyboard.  I noticed that it was difficult to type since the keys were not uniform.  Some required light touch and others required harder press.

My last laptop was such a piece of crap that I mostly used it for surfing anyway.  So I was mostly looking for a cheap web browser.  Chromebook is perfect for that.  It is super fast, light, and quiet (solid state drive).  As the Play Store gets more useful apps, it becomes more useful.  I can use Chrome's remote desktop to connect to my work computer (even without the VPN!).  I stream music, movies, and books from Google Play, Hulu, and Vudu.  The OS patches itself, so you don't need to patch Adobe and Java and SPx and antivirus and all that.  Every time you boot it checks for updates and installs if necessary.  Even then, it still take less than 10 seconds to boot.  All in all, this is not much different than a tablet, but I prefer its format.  Bottom line is, this is a great device for the price.On the down side, it is fairly limited offline.

Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch) 2012 Model;B009LL9VDG;[2, 2];5.0;I love my chromebook. For the price its an excellent ultra portable internet computer.  Their advertising says its for everyone and I disagree with that.  To me for certain people this device is as good or better than the most expensive laptops available.  But for some users it may be too limited.Hardware wise I think the keyboard is very good and full size, much better than I expected.  The touch pad is excellent, and I am not a big fan of using touch pads over a mouse.  The screen is good.  Its a little washed out and dull but its decent.  The screen is very good with glare.  The hardware performance is very good.  A little below a higher end desktop or laptop though.  On most web pages esp if you don't have many tabs open its as good as any higher end computer.  But some pages especially with many tabs open it doesn't perform as well as a higher end computer.  Video play back was very good. I played up to 720p without any problems.  Sometimes when the video first stared there was  a stutter but then it played flawless after that.  With 1080p it stuttered.Software wise I think its a good system for most people but not for everyone.  I don't think chromebook would be a power users main computer.  I consider myself a power user but for me its a secondary ultra portable computer.  I think its great for people who mostly turn on their computer and just open the brower.  It also does a little more than a regular browser, there is google's cloud office suite google drive.  There are also other apps and addons that can do stuff you expect from a computer.I think this device nails it for what it is trying to be.  An ultraportable cloud computer.  Its what netbooks should have been.  I think a lot of people buying ipads or windows 8 laptops would actually get value out of this device...but that depends on the users needs.  Can't wait to see next years which will likely be based on Samsungs 8 core processor.

Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch) 2012 Model;B009LL9VDG;[3, 3];5.0;Right now, I will be giving a short review,  I will be updating as I go along. I just got this a week ago.  My last laptop finally crashed on me after 5 years.  I was writing a resume.  Yeah, tell me about it.  Anyhow, I went on my kindle and did A LOT of research for a good reliable without all the bells and whistles.  I just needed it simple for writing, emails, and photos,  I don't play music and games.  Nothing fancy shmancy and fast especially when I'm looking for a job!  I needed my resumes fast!  This one had the highest rating and a lot of reviews were great and to my surprise, the price was extremely reasonable especially when I'm a budget after moving clear across the U. S.  I went ahead and ordered it.  Arrived on time.  Was able to do my resumes and fiddled with this notebook.  The set up is great.  Very easy to use.  The only thing I'm missing because I'm so used to keyboarding is the number pad but it's not the end of the world.  I'm in not the office or working with numbers.  The keypad is very comfortable using right off the bat.  The pressure is just right.  It's easy to navigate.  This notebook is just the size of a notebook,  Very slender, sleek and light weight.  (Geez, sounds like I'm describing a car!)  I'm able to access to all the websites I normally use.  The apps I normally use are already on it.  Only app I needed to download was Pixar Editor for my photos for now.  I haven't uploaded any photos from my Nikon camera yet which I will do in my free time.  I'm amazed how it's set up and how I'm able to access anything easily,  Heck I'm in my 40s and have A LOT of experiences with computers since the early 90s.  Your parents or grandparents should be able to get the hang of this realy quick.  Ok, I'm done for now and I will be updating on this along with other things such as my photos, hangout calls or any crashes or anything!  Btw, the speed is great when opening a page!  I hope this is helpful!  Just ask me anything!;08 31, 2013;ALRKH2US83BBX;Kat;Wow!;1377907200
Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch) 2012 Model;B009LL9VDG;[4, 4];5.0;"I wanted a computer that was fast and efficient, and didn't bother me with updates all the time. I wanted a device with a keyboard that I could use to surf the Internet, check email, type documents, create to-do lists, update my calendar, and complete quick calculations. I've found all of that and more with Chromebook.Now, as other reviewers have mentioned, the learning curve might be just a bit steep for those unused to Google's products (besides their search engine, of course). But I'm telling you, once you get the hang of using Google Docs for typing documents, Google slides for creating presentations, Google Calendar for setting dates, etc., you will not want to go back. If you lose your Chromebook or find yourself without it, you can go onto any device that connects to the Internet and find your documents, presentation, calendar, etc.Technically, you don't even need a Chromebook to use those products, just a Google account. But then you wouldn't have such an efficient, fast machine to use them on--and why would you ever want that?---------Just a couple notes on the downsides:1. Printing is an issue if you don't have a ""Cloud Print Ready"" printer. Since I don't, my computer scientist husband had to find a work-around.2. You cannot download external programs. I have to keep my old laptop around for when I want to use iTunes, Blackboard IM (for school), and my scanner. To me, it's no big deal, but don't think that you can use Chromebook for everything because you simply can't. To me, the pros completely outweigh the cons!";02 21, 2013;A1L1HGA660N3OO;Katherine Bodrie;Best Computer I've Ever Owned;1361404800

Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch) 2012 Model;B009LL9VDG;[2, 2];4.0;"The Samsung chromebook will not replace your laptop/desktop. At least not completely. It is best used as a laptop replacement when traveling or when you just don't want to lug a more expensive and heavier computer around. The chromebook is very light, seems well built and has very good battery life. I got 6.5 hours when using the track pad and about 5.0 hours if I used a wireless mouse. It boots in about 10 seconds, and is completely quiet. It has two usb ports. One is usb 2.0 the other 3.0. The 3.0 port will also allow you to plug in an ethernet adapter if you don't want to use or don't have wi-fi available. It also has a SD card reader on the side for viewing photos etc. or extra storage. Also, there is a webcam at the top of the screen. If you haven't used the ""Chrome"" browser, it's very easy to use. If you're looking for something more like a conventional laptop than a tablet, especially for internet use, I think you'll be very pleased with the chromebook.

LG 840G Prepaid Phone With Triple Minutes (Tracfone);B009LRNLW2;[4, 4];5.0;I can't believe I waited this long to switch.  Dumping my pricey T-mobile account and switching to the crazy affordable Tracfone has been fantastic. I was a little disappointed by the phone selection offered by Tracfone until I saw this LG 840G. It looks, and mostly acts like a smartphone at a fraction of the cost.  The camera is great and touchscreen is a breeze and very responsive.  This deal bundled with a year of minutes is by far the cheapest available anywhere.;02 26, 2013;AFEYHFH2GH0QZ;AJ;Switching to the crazy affordable Tracfone has been fantastic.;1361836800
LG 840G Prepaid Phone With Triple Minutes (Tracfone);B009LRNLW2;[0, 1];2.0;"I don't use much on browsing but Gmail. Phone signal is perfect but hard to even select &#34;Gmail&#34;, log in, and can't even remember my gmail account name and password like LG800. I'd thought that LG840 must be better than LG800 because it is newer model; but, it is the opposite when it comes to using Gmail account. Without thinking about ?30 day return, I tried to login to gmail for about 7 times from time to time. Besides, I don't use much browsing/gmail; unless, I am waiting for urgent message or to send. By the time, I realized that it is not the signal or the way I using and wrote to seller for return, replace, &/or credit. I guess it was few days over from the 30 day return limitation. Seller denied my return/replace/credit request which they have the right to deny for few days over the return limit date. I can send the phone back to the dealer with new SIM card like new so, dealer doesn't have any problem. Seller could have send me LG800 with triple min, without 1200 min, & credit me difference or store credit for my next purchase because, I will buy another one within a year. ay return limitation. Another option I wroted to the Seller was that the Seller doesn't need send me LG800 and I will send back their LG840 and all Seller has to do credit back the difference in dollar amount between LG840 & LG800 and I send it LG840 back with new SIM car to dealer at my expense. Seller just denied everything. I'm the bad one because I requested the return/replace/credit after 3 - 5 ?days? over?I even tried use pentip from other phone and still impossible to select and login to Gmail. Dealer sells the reasonable price for the tracfone LG800. Because, I don't like to return &#34;phone&#34; especially &#34;SIM' issue & I tried too hard and about 3 day bit too long to decide to return. I spent extra expense for an extra battery.

LG 840G Prepaid Phone With Triple Minutes (Tracfone);B009LRNLW2;[1, 1];4.0;I have only used Tracfone as my cell provider because its all I need. I buy the yearly plan which comes out to merely $9 a month which I am thrilled with compared to the prices everyone else pays with a contract plan.This phone is an amazing upgrade from my Motorola flip phone. Texting is more user friendly than before. I now enjoy having a camera, calender, and better calculator plus all the other features because of this phone.Wi fi functionality is limited. For me it is adequate as I only need to access email, weather reports, stock prices, and public transportation schedules. The default browser is unresponsive. I downloaded Opera Mini from other reviewers suggestions and it works much better. You will not be watching movies or videos on this phone but as I say if you want the big thrills than be ready to pay the big bills. If you want a phone that functions like a laptop in your pocket than this phone is not for you. Others have suggested ways to tweak Opera Mini to make it more functional but I haven't needed to do that yet.Transferring my minutes from my old Tracfone took a little effort. I couldn't do it online so I had to contact customer service in Miami and they were great. Just be prepared to enter a lot of activation numbers into the new phone when you call.

"PharmaFreak Anabolic Freak Hormone &amp; Testosterone Stimulator, 96 Count";B009M3OEFI;[16, 16];4.0;"This is the first product of its kind that I have found that actually works. I've tried Tribulus and a few others. This does what it claims to do. There are also side effects. So I'll make some lists:The Good:- Increased recovery. After being on it for a few weeks I can blast any bodypart at the gym and be sure that the only thing I'll feel the next day is a bit of tightness and larger. Even training legs is easier the day after... no DOMS...- Increased appetite. OH ... you will EAT !- I personally gained about 8lbs on it. A little over half was lean mass. That's not bad for about a month. Sounds like I work for the company eh? Well I don't! My biceps gained about 1.25&#34; alone. Like I said, it does what it claims...- You don't get a lot of the hormonal side effects you get with synthetics since you're just asking your body to produce more test. That said the gains aren't as dramatic as you would experience on synthetics.The Bad:- Upsets your stomach something fierce. You WILL get the runs. Make no mistake. You just have to decide if you're willing to deal with that and get some awesome gains.- You get the Alpha-Male feeling ... no ragin' or whatnot, but you will notice that things that irritated you prior will now anger you.- Deeper voice? My voice changed a bit .. or maybe I have spring allergies. I see this as a supplement for dudes anyway, so this isn't that bad. Women don't have the right parts for this stuff to work properly. It's not a synthetic steroid. The test you produce is yours. It does this this by stimulating certain male anatomy... not really sure what the result would be for a female.- Since you're swallowing and not injecting it, you have to keep in mind the load you're putting on your system. Liver, kidneys, glands, etc.The Ugly:- Some mild hair-loss for me. I am genetically pre-disposed to this... which sucks.. but I did notice some thinning. Nothing terrible. If it would have gotten too bad I wouldn't have finished the bottle.Conclusion:I'll probably use it in the future, but sparingly. Probably twice / year during bulk cycles. It has its benefits, but you have to consider why you are doing what you're doing? Are you working out to be healthier or for other reasons. For me it was half health and half aesthetics, thus I'm willing to accept some risk... So do some soul searching, check with your doctor, and so on. The stuff does work for 4/5 males, but it has its side effects.I rated it a 4/5 because it works well but has side effects. Would I recommend to a friend? Maybe ...";04 25, 2013;A3M8K5IDVFI2D4;"A.

;B009NMYC4Q;[1, 1];4.0;"This book is a journey through the writer's life so far, looking at the ups and downs in her health and relationships and her past lives, and relating the reasons to her physical ill health to her state of mind. This is not all doom and gloom as Carol Deans has a very witty style of writing and does at times refuse to take herself too seriously. The book is well written and gives a lot of insight to past life regression and spiritual growth.This writer is a healer who has helped many people and has led a very diverse life. She has met some pretty amazing people who, in turn have helped her on her way. There is an appendix to the book with self help advice including meditation, recording your dreams and using colour in visualisation some of which I found helpful and original.Some small criticisms, I felt there was too much emphasis on the details of the past life regressions and not enough continuity between different phases of Carols life, how did she get from one place to another? Who was with her? etc., details that make the reader feel more involved in the story.However, on the whole this is a very readable book. One piece of advice given to the writer which stayed with me was;`Do it in struggle or do it in joy- it's the same lifespan.'What better way to bring you down to earth and keep you positive.";02 12, 2013;AQL17UEHNTV3S;"Janette Skinner ""best-book-review.co.uk""";A difficult life journey;1360627200

Monster DNA On-Ear Headphones (Black);B009P2S4G6;[2, 2];4.0;"I do not like to put anything in my ears so when I had the chance to get these headphones for my Ipad mini instead of having to purchase earbuds, I jumped on it. I opened the box that arrived and everything seemed high quality. The headphones fold which is nice and there is a nice velvety case included. A cleaning cloth is even included. There are two cords. Not really sure what the difference is yet. Probably different devices because there's a tag on one cord that says some features are only available on certain phones and players.&#34; Speaking of high quality, the cords are wrapped in some soft Velcro instead of just twisty ties lol. The colors available are nice, but I hope they make pink and purple sometime lol. As far as the sound, I am listening to music right now with them and it works for me. I haven't tested any other headphones so thats why I can't say these are the best. But I am liking the base on these headphones. I think these are kinda pricey. I'd be more likely to purchase these at $100 than the listed $200 but if you can afford these and are an avid music listener, I would recommend these. It would be worth your while to test other brands since you are investing a decent amount of money in headphones but I don't see anything bad about these. They are soft and comfortable as well.

Monster DNA On-Ear Headphones (Black);B009P2S4G6;[1, 1];4.0;I bought these headphones for my wife and my personal headphones are the Bose AE2's, which are also very nice. This review will discuss these generally as well as make comparisons to the Bose, and will discuss our primary concerns - use on an airplane, comfort, and sound quality.We were initially looking for some headphones that would be good for use on an airplane. We had taken several trips and attempted to listen to music or movies and other headphones we had were almost impossible to hear, even at maximum volumes.After testing numerous sets, we were the most interested in the Bose noise canceling headphones (both the in-ear and over-the-ear are AMAZING). However, we both wanted a pair of nice headphones and couldn't bring ourselves to drop that much money. I decided on the less expensive Bose AE2s and my wife chose the DNAs.  We got both sets for less than even the refurbished price of one set of Bose noise canceling.On a recent plane trip they both performed well. Neither of these pairs are noise *reducing, but they do *isolate the noise fairly well, and both were able to be heard clearly in that setting. The daisy chain feature of the DNA's (which allows you to share the audio connection of the DNAs) was very useful. The impedance of these two sets is not the same, meaning that even though we were connected to the same device, the two sets played at different volumes. This was not a huge issue and would be improved if we both had DNAs (probably the manufacturer's intention).Comfort - these headphones sit on the ear, which is not my personal preference (I prefer the over-the-ear fit of the Bose), but they are very comfortable even for long listening times.Regarding sound quality - on my device they have a slight buzz even with no music playing. This is not the case with the Bose, and that noise is still audible if you listen for it while audio is playing. The effect is a less-clean sound than the Bose, but overall their sound quality is still very good. They also have a much stronger bass than the Bose headphones.Anyway, my wife loves these headphones and they have met our needs.;03 28, 2014;AS9XA6FCPJ7K4;Jay Dee;Great headphones;1395964800

Although, he is the kind of kid that takes really really&#8230; good care of his stuff.  The pouch will prevent them from getting scratches.  The sound quality is amazing - the one time that he let me listen to them and the best thing about them to me is that when you have them on, and the volume is high, others around you won't be able to hear what you're listening to.  I would highly recommend these.";01 9, 2014;AJ3TVDTKWDZY5;L. Perez;My son LOVES his Monster's!!!;1389225600

;B009P9TZJY;[10, 14];5.0;"I'm not a 9/11 conspiracy theorist. But I have a (weird?) fascination with 9/11 conspiracy theories anyway; they form a sort of folklore in our country and outline the emotional contour of our modern political situations in some very interesting ways. Webster Tarpley is famous (?) for his books on conspiracy and specifically 9/11 conspiracy. He has an almost virtuoso ability at conspiracy theory and is far, far more historically informed than most people on the subject. I've watched various videos of Tarpley online and one really gets the sense that he cares about this country and is deeply concerned about what is going on. Whether or not he generates these conspiracy theories out of a real quest for the truth I'm not sure, but in a bizarre way he often seems very, very convincing. His book on Romney is especially convincing and contains very little conspiracy from what I can tell... Americans seem to write off Mormonism as ""just another Judeo-Christian religion"", but this is patently not the case. I really recommend this book. Tarpley, if not exactly the mouthpiece of verisimilitude, is genuinely fascinating and critical.";10 24, 2012;AXZH339L3JGI6;Ryan D. Hayes;From Deseret to D.C....;1351036800

This allows me to use the GS3 long USB charging cable in the car, eliminating any stress-tension and its resulting damage.

"Yiynova MSP19U+ Tablet Monitor,VESA Stand(Mac &amp; Windows Solution)";B009QQ7BG0;[3, 3];5.0;"I was very nervous about buying this, as I'm pretty broke most of the time and this was a big investment.I use a Cintiq at the college I attend and after using that, I just couldn't seem to use my tablet the same way. I do commissions for extra cash ( because BROKE ) and I needed something better than the poor old tablet I'd been slowly working to death.I poured over reviews for this thing and, months later, made my purchase. I was scared.However, I couldn't be happier!The support team for this thing is GREAT. I  had an issue with a pen they sent me, so I emailed them, hoping for a reply. I got a reply within the hour, and proceeded to be in constant contact with them for the next week. They sent me a new pen with no problems at all. I am SO grateful for that. They even continued to email me, just to make sure everything was going okay with my Yiynova. Love!As far as the monitor itself is concerned, it isn't a Cintiq. It's just not.It feels different and the picture quality is different. I have a harder time doing smooth lineart in Photoshop and the driver gets confused if I switch from arting to typing and I have to reset it, which is easy enough to do. I wish there were more settings to tweak. The pen gets a bit shaky if the battery is about to die. However, it takes one AA battery, and that lasts a long time.I have my Yiynova hooked up to a very old computer with windows 7, 3 Gigs of RAM and a dysfunctional graphics card. It works. It lags sometimes, thanks to my magnificent machine, but it works.Once you adjust to the Yiynova's unique ""personality"", it's great. I can art much faster than I could with my Intuos tablet,and a lot of the stuff I do just LOOKS better. I have FUN drawing again. Doing big projects with my tablet always seemed like a chore. I have a shaky hand and my line art really suffered because of it. I loaded up Manga Studio 5 on this thing and WOW. It's magic. I'm sold. I am so happy. It works perfectly. Paint Tool Sai did not work perfectly, however, but that's okay. I don't really like Sai.Overall, if you're a digital artist and you don't have a lot of cash, but you LOVE what you do and it is your favorite hobby and you tend to spend all your extra $$$ on art stuff anyways, BUY THIS. If you just sort of piddle around with art now and again, but don't really care.. stick with a tablet. This thing can be a little frustrating for a person who isn't just dead-set on learning it. Like I said: It's not a Cintiq. Don't treat it like a Cintiq. If you want a Cintiq, buy a Cintiq. If you're willing to give something else a go, something wonderful and MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE, grab this thing. It's great. I'm glad I did. I will probably work this thing to death, as is tradition, and continue to purchase from this company. They deserve my money for bringing an affordable arting monitor to those of us who love what we do but can't shell out $2K.";10 26, 2013;A3ML1T3JED7JNP;"Froo ""Do'er of Stuff""";Happy, overall!;1382745600

Zenus SANT2-MLLDY-KK Lettering Diary for Galaxy Note 2 - Retail Packaging - Deep Khaki;B009SF90JU;[0, 1];4.0;This is a nice case, good solid feel, the leatheroid stuff is almost leathery enough to fool me, it holds the phone surprisingly well given the design (I tried the case with real leather and metal buttons, same design of the cradle-thing that holds the phone, and it fell out when shaken, whereas this one managed to maintain its clench even though I held it upside down and shook it forcefully. Extreme, you may say, but I tell you that I am VERY unkind to my technological devices and if a piece of equipment is going to pal around with me it needs to withstand shaking, folding, spindling, and being absentmindedly sat on.) and I could even learn to get used to the 'writing' all over it which I cannot help but try to read and what I can make out, I don't much care for. If it had Lorem Ipsum all over it, I would have taken it into my heart and forgiven it its sins, which are: it's not $50 worth of nice, and its corners leave the Note exposed to the aforementioned banging, chewing, bumping and grinding. I almost kept it anyway, but I have chosen another case and i can't see myself needing two cases, one for everyday and one for formal wear, when I don't even own more than one pair of shoes without holes.;06 29, 2013;A8GKQX93GZM0K;Ben Dover;Yep, it's nice... but not THAT nice;1372464000

"Black - Samsung Galaxy Note 2 Tridea 100% Premium Italian PU Credit Card Holder Flip Case AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint , T-Mobile and Unlocked";B009SNTHPO;[0, 0];5.0;This is hands down the best case I have ever owned.Pros:Stylish. The materials feels like real leather although it probably isn't and it just looks great. It gives my phone such a stylish upgrade and it just feels smooth without losing grip in your hands.The best protection for the screen. I have a screen protector on and it protects the screen just fine but having the cover over gives me more of a easy of mind that no matter what, the screen will be protected. The case also protects the back and some the side of the phone but doesn't really protect the top and bottom parts of the phone.Flip cover is great with the Smart Screen Off app. The app detects if the sensors on top of the phone are covered. When you flip the case open, the screen turns on. When you close the cover, the screen turns off. It's a must app for people with flip cases. It's in the app store if anyone is interested.Great little slot for cards and etc. I use the slot for my ID card and my gym card whenever I go to the gym so I don't have to carry my wallet around.Cons:Little to no protection on the top and bottom part of the phone. Not sure why the maker didn't protect the top and bottom part but it would be amazing if it could protect every part of your phone.;01 5, 2013;A2LI8L6O4M0G1K;CuriousEggroll;Best case I have ever owned;1357344000

;B009SPL2K0;[2, 3];1.0;"Actually, 1 star is too generous! A friend of mine purchased MS Office Home and Student 2013. I help people with computer issues part-time for a living, but installing this software has been the most FRUSTRATING experience I've had to deal with! Her computer is a brand new Toshiba Satellite L850, 64-bit, and the only programs installed since its arrival are Dropbox and MS Office 365 Trial Version (which was a nightmare for her to try to install and she never got to use it, and I'm sure it's the reason for my continuing nightmare...) and it's expired. So we downloaded the Product Key, tried to install unsuccessfully 6 separate times, following exact instructions, also online, also by phone, after searching the web and finding actual helpful info, like ""find the folders named Microsoft Office 15 (?) and DELETE, THEN uninstall Office 365"", rebooted, tried again from scratch, and finally at the 7th install, went as far as the ""We're wrapping things up...please stay online while we make finishing touches"" message (after that other fun one: ""Office may seem unresponsive..."" it doesn't ""SEEM"" so, it IS UNRESPONSIVE!. Well, that ""Wrapping"" message box hung there for literally 24 hours, not moving after the halfway area. I tested Word and Excel at that point and they both opened fine, saved, renamed documents, all seemed well! Meanwhile, my friend contacted MS Sales (Support wouldn't answer) who said it was FINE to turn it off (so I could bring her laptop back to her). I was nervous about shutting down, as it said ""stay online"", but at the same time, it wasn't DOING anything! And when we turned it back on today, Office doesn't work anymore - message saying ""Office ran into problems...please connect to the internet or try a different network"" (we WERE connected and all other websites worked fine).My friend is an AUTHOR. She's in the end stages of getting her book to publishing. She paid for Office! I can't fix it and she's paid me for doing all this work, it was working fine last night, and a MICROSOFT EMPLOYEE TOLD HER it was ""okay to turn off the laptop"". Well, it WASN'T!!! She took it home and now I'm left to figure out how to fix this mess! WHAT IS MICROSOFT DOING?!?!?! Complaints ALL OVER the internet about this SAME THING!! Are they listening to anyone out here? I'm thinking small claims court next...this is just RIDICULOUS!!! In the meantime, I'll teach her to use Open Office or LibreOffice and just move on away from Microsoft...they just ain't what they used to be!! DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM, SERIOUSLY, UNLESS YOU ARE GEARED UP FOR LITERALLY DAYS OF TORTURE AND NO SOLUTION TO IT!!!!";05 9, 2013;A3C8O933Q8TVXP;"Allie ""Allieocity""";Microsoft must be losing it...UNBELIEVEABLE installation mess!!!;1368057600

;B009SPL2K0;[0, 0];4.0;I already reviewed the Home & Business version, but just a note here that I did need Publisher on one of my computers, and I found it worth the upgrade to get the Professional version with Publisher. I will never use Access so I wish they had a version with Publisher only, but they likely never will until they discontinue Access. So, if you need Publisher, this is a good buy. You may also consider the Office 365, but I still like paying a one time fee for my software instead of an annual license fee.;10 12, 2013;A1143YEAZYMYHJ;Jamie Ratliff;Professional Version Is Worth the Extra $$$ If You Need Publisher;1381536000

The funny articles, crafts, media discussion, health and fashion advice and other goodies are great supplements to deeper articles, that cover super-important and modern topics like cutting, reaching out to a friend who's been through sexual abuse and how to break up with a guy properly. Plus I LOVE their new series that spotlights a different religion every month, clarifying what that religion believes, how to touch people of that faith, and what the Bible says about it!The only thing I HATE HATE HATE about this is that there is no longer a guy counterpart magazine.

;B009W78KAE;[13, 14];5.0;Every now and then, I go on Amazon and look at what free books are available to download to my Kindle app. This was on of them. Although at the moment there isn't a picture available on Goodreads, the picture on Amazon is what gripped me.This was a VERY short read. In my opinion, it has to be the best short story I've read to date. This story starts out with a girl named Kit who has been having dreams about a specific, unknown illness that causes humans to start deteriorating and eventually die only to get up and start walking among the living once again. Her dreams turn out to have been a prediction. The story continues in New York with four main characters that have no idea about this illness until they experience it first hand. On a journey to Illinois to escape the epidemic yet find the source of it all, the truth is uncovered.My emotions were all over the place with this story! I just..I can't even tell you how I feel trying to write this review. The story wasn't scary at all, but I don't think the author was shooting for horror. It was an emotional ride, for sure. I'm sure once you start reading this, you'll know and understand that some characters that you've grown to love will die. The way the deaths are portrayed through the words, though, just kills me. Almost literally. It's so sad! I won't say I cried reading this, but I will admit that I teared up. It gave me a whole new perspective on zombies;11 1, 2012;A2GWGD33YX9VA;Andrea;Best Short Story I've Read!;1351728000

;B009XNG7RA;[0, 0];4.0;I was terribly excited to see that the next volume of the Alfonzo series was out, and my excitement was not in vain. Aftermath is a good title for this volume, because while it did not follow the classic setup of a book (rising drama, climax, and resolution), it did give the reader some idea of what happend after the very exciting and climactic previous volume. Aftermath follows Alfonzo, Geo, and Nico after the death of Alberti, and displays how they cope and try to move on. Some new characters are introduced, and some old favorites find themselves in a period of transition, moving on to a life no one expected. All in all, I enjoyed it, and as usual look forward to the next volume.;11 2, 2012;A1JU26EM4TEB7B;danikat;Good followup;1351814400

Nature's Miracle Single Self-Cleaning Cat Litter Box;B009ZBXXXG;[4, 6];3.0;Now,  we have only had this unit for a week with a new cat.  Love it so far.  The cleaning works well.  The unit is a bit noisy,  but upstairs in our laundry room this is not an issue.  Our cat, a rescued stray,  has no problems with it.  He is a bit overzealous when covering his deed, and that does require some manual intervention to smooth out the litter after the cleaning cycle.Update after about 3 months:Had to take this down a couple stars.  After about a month it stopped in mid-cycle.  After trying in vain to get it working again I called customer support.  I described the situation and was told to unplug it, push the little return/stop button 10 times,  wait 20 minutes and then plug it back in. If it still didn't work, call back.  Now,  this did not make much sense to me as this is a pretty simple mechanical devise,  not a computer that needs resetting,  but I tried it anyway.  Surprise,  it did not work.  I tried calling, but it was late Friday and they were already closed. I would have to wait until Monday.  Faced with the situation of a non functional litter box with the mechanism stuck about half way,  I decided to see if I could find a lose wire or something.  I took the thing apart and found that there is a cheap ribbon cable that sends the power to the carriage.  The ribbon cable had become disconnected.  The ribbon cable is held in place by some thick tape.  The stationary end it pulled off some how.  I reconnected it,  reinforced the connection a bit and it has been working fine for about a month.I still like the box as it works fine now.

Clip-Case Universal Smartphone Mount and Ergonomic Tablet Stand (Tripod Mount Kit) for iPhone iPad iPod Galaxy Droid Kindle Nook;B00A1DJO12;[1, 1];5.0;"Phone and tablet stands and tripods are a dime a dozen, but they have to be because you'll need to shell out cash for a new one for each new phone or tablet you buy (and that can get awfully expensive), but this ones different; its one of the only mounts that is guaranteed to work with your device.The reason they can guarantee this is the smart clip. By using a glue patch to mount the clip to a your phone or tablet's case you're able to mount just about anything to the smart mount which in this configuration is a nifty little tripod (but it will also work with any screw on to any standard tripod (or Joby Gorillapod Original Black/Charcoal - Joby GP1-B1AM) as well as some bike mounts and this suction mountClip-Case Suction Cup Windshield Dashboard Car Mount Kit (Universal with Any Tablet, Smartphone, or GPS) - iPhone iPad iPod Galaxy Droid Kindle Nook).The glue pad that comes with the kit is ""one time use"" and it sticks very well, but I suspect that you could scrape it off with a razor blade or a kitchen knife. Then you could mount it to your next phone's case. I don't see it here on amazon, but the manufacturer seems to also sell the smart clip separately on its website so you could buy a few if you have multiple devices that you'd want to use without pulling them off the case.The only possible drawback that I see is that the clip is a little large, so you won't want to mount it to your phone's case if you like to keep your phone in a pocket (it could work on your belt though). I have seen a few other mounts that grasp the device and consider themselves ""universal."" You'll have to weigh your options here, but I would feel a little limited with the ""grasping"" mount. Most are designed for normal phones, but with new form factors like tablets and phablets (giant phone-tablets) becoming popular you're likely to want something that really is universal.Enough about the universalness though. The build quality on the tripod is great and the single adjustment knob allows for a wide range of viewing/shooting angles. The angle seems to hold well (it doesn't shift while watching a movie let alone for taking a 1 second picture). I also love that the whole tripod folds down to the size of a fat marker or maybe a little smaller than a Wii remote.The whole setup feels like it will last through several phones/tablets/ or whatever they invent next. If you're looking for a tripod/ mounting system that will work great today and just as well in 5 years this is it.5 Stars";03 31, 2013;A2IZ9ZSFBW7JX8;"W.

You Choose Your Size (2mm);B00A1S3ND2;[2, 3];5.0;I ordered a small pair of the CZ studs offered by this seller, and while they are inexpensive, I didn't receive them at first.  I wrote to the seller, and he or she very promptly put these in the mail without ever asking a question.  While I was truthful, you've still got to appreciate a seller that takes you at your word!

I bought the 2 mm earrings, and to me, they look like a 1/4 ct total set of earrings.  They are shiny and very pretty.  The ad says they are surgical steel, and they must be.

I did get the warning that it is not a compatible battery when I booted up the machine.  But it works fine anyway so I went into the BIOS and disabled the warning.

I returned it yesterday as well, and made a quick trip to Dick's Sporting Goods where I bought a Youth Small (isn't that weird!) that looks like it will do the trick.

LEGO Chima Target Practice 70101;B00A850UQ6;[0, 0];3.0;"I bought this set JUST for the ""Equila"" minifig. So I'll start with that. Undoubtedly, it's MAGNIFICENT! The details and markings on the body are great! The head piece is especially the best part. And the wings also look cool!This set also contains three small  ravens (they are micro-builds actually). But I think this raven has been designed very creatively, by using the most basic bricks. So that was a pretty good imagination from the LEGO designers.This set also contains a technic-gun fitted to a nice-looking bullseye (which is a printed brick and thankfully not a sticker)!The speedor looks good (the key word here being ""looks""). I wish it worked  better. When I bought my first speedor set, I was very happy! I liked the way it moved very fast and the way of using the rip-cord thing to rev-up the speedor was good. But as I bought more speedors, my interest in them reduced tremendously. The thing is , some speedors , with attachments move well. And when you remove the attachments, it's difficult to get them to move properly. Also, as you know, each speedor comes with a different kind of attachment. And this attachment affects the way the speedors move. As an example, the attachments for Crominus' and Longtooth's speedors make them move nicely but the attachment for Wakz's speedor makes it move horribly! Even in this set, when I fix the attachment to Equila's speedor,  and let it go (after pulling the rip-cord, of course), then the speedor takes a U-turn after going some distance! This happened very time with Equila's speedor , when I fixed the attachment to it. Also, when you try to run a speedor WITHOUT any attachment, there's only a 50% chance that it will move properly.Another problem with this speedor is that in order to fit the minifig on the speedor, everytime you have to disassemble and then assemble it.The speedor has one big when in the front. If there were two small wheels at the back, then the speedor would have moved MUCH better and then people would have liked it better.From what I have seen on the net, currently the Speedors aren't very popular. So, unless LEGO does some serious design change in the speedor to improve it's playability, people will not buy them.If you like collecting awesome minifigs, THEN ONLY you buy this..Else if you can afford the ""Wakz Pack Tracker"" set, then go for it as it has the ""Equila"" minifig and lots of other great stuff. But DON'T buy this just for the Speedor..you will be disappointed.";04 7, 2013;A2AEFJLAIDWRIR;Attidude;"Great Minifig; Speedor is disappointing";1365292800

;B00A8ECU24;[2, 3];5.0;Use GEMS wisely!  They are the premium currency in the game, and if you don't want to pay $$$, don't use them unless necessary.  Don't use them to feed Spike at the beginning to speed up building, don't use them on non essential ponies, no matter how tempting Lyra Heartstrings being only 10 gems is!  Use them only for Rarity and Rainbow Dash.  Don't skip parasprites, or Pinky's pony friend(Derpy) in the cardboard box.  Remember that you can cash in old shops that you don't really need anymore and get bits(coins) back. This is a very addictive game, and sign up on the gameloft site and get as many 'friends' as possible, it's really easy to do, you get hearts and get more coins and gems that way too!

And of course, if you are not patient, you have to spend money to go forward. I mean some people who chose not to spend money, wait for 6 months to pass a quest. The friend system was faulty even before it went down. You couldn't visit your friends, it would just kicked you out of the game. Again, that's for kindle fire.

Out of Love Cookbook by Lucy Postins founder of The Honest Kitchen;B00A8O1ZD4;[1, 1];4.0;I really like the way this book is broken out into sections- meals, treats, food as medicine, etc. Easy to follow recipes, some have some crazy ingredients that I am still looking for at the health food store, but there are a lot of easy to follow recipes too. Only complaint is that a lot of the recipes use an Honest Kitchen product as an ingredient. And had I known that in advance, I may not have bought the book. But it's a good book to have- I've made the butternut bites so far, and the dogs love them.

;B00A92MD8G;[4, 8];3.0;Generally formulaic:  Threatened, bewildered homesteader lady goes mooney-eyed over brooding, mysterious,coincidentally well-armed saddletramp who beats back the bad guys from her door.  Beautiful scenery and believable period settings, but I found the story lacked continuity, and didn't explain itself very well, so you may miss some of the next scene while still trying to rationalise the previous one.  I gave this movie three stars for its atmosphere and sincerity, in spite of Ed Harris's continuing discomfort under a cowboy hat (Appaloosa).  Wedging Harris in a Zane Grey story is like casting Tom Selleck in a Louis L'amour western ... it's safe entertainment, nice to look at,  and a good box office bet, but it ain't no Lonesome Dove.  I wish we could please dispense with the repetitive John Wayne-ish requirement for handy gullible citizenry to play off of.  And hey, we don't need no stinkin' romance in a western for it to be a good story.  It just gets in the way, and besides, a cowboy's indispensable companion in L'amour's stories was his horse!;04 6, 2013;A1CIKUEFNICRF9;B. R.

It will cut anything from vegetables to meat with very little effort.I'd like to keep this review sweet and short. It's a nice knife that you have to use and feel before you can appreciate it.

You can also purchase additional cookie disks sets:OXO Good Grips Cookie Press Springtime Disk SetAfter screwing the dough tube in place and making sure the plunger is pulled out of the tube, simply spoon cookie dough into tube, add cookie disk and attach top ring.  You will need to prime the press by continuing to pump the handle until dough starts to come out of the cookie disk then simply place cookie press onto cookie sheet, making sure the top ring is flat and level, and press handle.  This leaves a perfect cookie ""cut-out"" without the hassle of using cookie cutters.  Repeat the process until your cookie sheet is covered in cookies and bake.  If you want various cookie shapes, changing the design is also quick and easy.  No need to wait until the dough tube is empty-just remove lid, replace cookie disk and continue.

The stainless steel design discs are of excellent quality especially, and the plastic case for them has great details, including vents in case you pack 'em away after cleaning. I really like the set-up of it and how the press does the work of knowing how much dough to dispense.The main problem I found in using it is that it requires a special consistency of dough. I have a favorite recipe for figured cookies, and that stiff dough just won't work with this press. Either my wrist was going to break, or the cookie press, or both. Oxo, in an included booklet, provides three recipes they say work with the press, but that was a warning sign to me as soon as I saw it. To me that means, okay, it does *not* work with certain doughs, then, and may not work with the one I wanted to use it with. I have some suggestions for using it and will get to those later. You may be more interested in the cookies themselves!The designs are approximately 1"" x 1 1/2"", creating bite-sized cookies. There are three Christmas designs: a tree, snowflake, and wreath. There are three flower designs: a buttercup, daisy, and sunflower. There are an additional six designs: a bear, butterfly, fleur de lis, heart, leaf, and shell.Here are some things I have learned along the way:(1) You must use moist dough. If your favorite figured cookie dough doesn't work, you can try adding a little more liquid until it goes through easily. Don't force the press. If the lever doesn't press down easily, the dough is too stiff.(2) It's best to use the plunger (just by hand) while adding dough. Add a bit of dough, then use the plunger to tamp it down. Repeat until the chamber is full. Having the dough pressed in well to begin with will help the cookies turn out better and come out of the press more consistently.(3) Not all of the designs work as well as others. There are some that have such thin openings, the dough has a tough time getting through. I've also found that the butterfly tends to break after baking since it's so thin where the wings attach to the body; the bear had similar problems. Be sure to try all of them so you can find the ones that work best for you. Of course, eating any broken cookies isn't a bad thing.(4) Because it makes such bite-sized cookies, the baking duration on your favorite recipe may have to be lowered.I was set to give the press one-star when I first started using it, but these steps have helped me to really like it! The only reason I took a star off is because I wish the cookie press had more ""oomph"" and ability to handle dough with a thicker consistency.";12 28, 2012;A2I4A4WGWII18Z;Sunny Sewing Honeybee;Worth the work to figure it out!;1356652800

Everyone Soap for Every Kid, Orange Squeeze, 32 Ounce;B00ADJEU68;[0, 0];5.0;"There's nothing special about the cleaning power of this soap, it gets the kids clean and they smell good when they get out of the shower.  BUT, but . . . it's sooo much better for your skin because it doesn't have all that junk that most soap has.  So to me, the slightly higher price is worth it to know that my kids aren't putting a bunch of unnecessary chemicals on their skin (and let's face it, inadvertently into their eyes and mouths, too).The smell is nice and there is enough lather so the kids know where the soap has been, but then that lather easily washes off (we tend to get lots of J&J; Baby Wash left behind in their hair, but not this soap).  Also, the pump makes it easy for the kids to get just the amount they need and not have to fumble with taking a cap on and off.";12 28, 2013;A1C3WVI1KFXR88;Penelope D.;It's just soap, but it's better-for-you soap.;1388188800

;B00ADSAWBQ;[0, 0];3.0;"The format of the book and it's spelling/grammar could use some work.  To the format, I agree with other reviewers, I believe many of us prefer shorter chapters so we can either read a chapter or two on a short break or devour several at a time. It gives a more natural feel of progression through the story as well.  The typos/errors in the writing definitely aren't the worst I've ever seen, but the review/editing process needs a little more time as there are still a few sore spots that stand out in the writing.  The flow and style of writing are also a little choppy and ""amateaurish.""  This felt a bit like an attempt from someone new to writing - you can tell the story is great in their head/imagination, but they're having some trouble translating it to the reader.  Some descriptions in the story aren't needed (obvious or redundant) while other scenes leave you feeling like you didn't quite ""get"" the full picture of what was going on.***SPOILERS AHEAD***The ideas presented in the story do make for a good read, but I believe they could have been developed quite a bit better. The relationships and charachter development as well as the resolutions to the climax in the book all left something to be desired for me.  Where is the history for Rebecca and Ashley that help you to connect with the main characters in the book?  Tell us more about how they interact with each other, because Ashley speaks very little and yet they seem so attached to each other?  How - just magic?  Then the big build-up to the end (which could use a little more suspense/mystery/details i.e. development) where the greatly-feared, evil Sorceress is risen and then is so easily killed by several gunshots?  Really!?  What a disappointment.  :(Overall it was an okay read, because I do love the ideas presented, but could see it having the potential to be so much more.  Especially with the ending, which felt almost like a slap in the face - Wait!  You mean that's it!?  It was like the author was so exhausted or excited about finishing that they rushed it and killed the whole story in a couple of paragraphs.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for my review.";01 31, 2013;A1768F8E8ZS0G0;Laura;Good idea, good starts, has potential to be MUCH better...;1359590400

Later measured the short circuit current capability of the old batteries. The one that screamed could only put out 0.3A, two could do about 0.7A, and one could do 1.4A so was probably fine.

;B00AEZT4YO;[45, 50];5.0;"It's always a daunting task to write a review of a book not only widely read but also extremely popular. Especially after one read of the primary text (and no knowledge whatsoever of the musical, aside from the minute or so of the previews shown for the upcoming release). So rather than wax poetic about Hugo's insanely thorough, beautiful writing as many others have done, let me simply give you my impression of Les Mis&eacute;rables.The first 10% or so of the Kindle edition that I read dealt primarily with a description of Bishop Myriel. About 5% in I was a bit confused, wondering why all this information was necessary for a character that, admitted by Hugo, was not an integral part of the book. However, I managed to fall in love with that sacrificing Bishop and felt I knew him so intimately that by the time Jean Valjean arrived on the scene, I could predict the good Bishops movements. And aside here, the letter and actions of the Bishops sister and housekeeper had me laughing and thoroughly enjoying myself, mostly because I, as an unmarried woman in today's society, would never have been able to so meekly assist my brother in that way.Jean Valjean - such a character. 19 years spent in horrific conditions all because he stole some bread. After his run-in with the Bishop, his encounter with Petit Gervais, and his arrival in Montreuil-sur-Mer I began to get an idea of why the Bishop was such an important character to begin the book with. It was a beautiful thing to see the changes being wrought in Valjean.And then there comes Fantine. Honestly, I think Fantine is my second favorite character of the book (second to Bishop Myriel, I really did love that old man). She is the perfect tragic figure: mother to a beautiful child, abandoned by her lover, trust-worthy to a fault, abused, neglected, self-sacrificing, and all of it unrewarded until she lay on her deathbed... but even then happiness is denied to her. As miserable as Valjeans life was throughout the book, I think Fantine's situation is what really gives weight to the title that Hugo chose.And from Fantine there comes Cosette. Although there is plenty in the book about the girl, and then the young woman Cosette, I came away with less of an impression of her than of the other characters. In fact, I felt more connected to Marius than Cosette - although that might have been simply because Cosette comes off as a bit of a wimp, not due to anything that Hugo does, necessarily. It's just strange to read about her passive behavior from a 21st century perspective.The only other main character I want to touch on is Javert. Javert was the epitome of fear to me. He had a nasty habit of always showing up in a city filled with people, leaving the correct impression that he and Valjean were connected in a way that could never be broken. I appreciated Hugo's treatment of the torment that filled Javert at the end of the book and thought that his story ended in a most fitting manner.Hugo spends time not telling the stories of these main characters by elaborating on everything from an incredibly detailed description of the Battle of Waterloo (of which I now know more information than I know how to deal with), slang, the street urchin or gamin, the sewers of Paris, religious orders, and politics. Of these I found Waterloo, the religious order description, and the information on slang to be the most interesting. I read the Hapgood translation of the book for Kindle, and was rewarded with a lengthy introduction and beautiful illustrations throughout the book that enhanced the reading. I laughed, cried, felt sympathy, and completely immersed myself in this story and came away from it feeling richer - and that feeling is how I know I just read something incredible.";12 23, 2012;AOKGRSAS5VNS3;"Lydia ""The Lost Entwife""";Review of Les Miserables;1356220800

Pantene Pro-V Truly Natural Hair Defining Curls Styling Custard 7.6 Fl Oz;B00AFCP76A;[17, 17];5.0;When it comes to Curl custards, curl cremes etc... I think I'm the Curl Queen.  I have tried many, so  when it comes to my hair I know exactly what I'm looking for in a product.  I'm happy to say that I have added Pantene's Defining Curls Styling  Custard to my regimen.  Like most products, it's all about technique.I need a creme that defines my natural curl and gives it a strong hold,  almost like a set.  A good custard will give me a set that lasts a week.  My hair is long and very curly.  I wear it long and curly with no frizz.  I apply a leave-in moisturizer and then this great custard.  My long hair air dries and is completely dry after only an hour and a half.  This is fantastic for me!  If I want to switch it up, this product is also great for me to sleek my hair into a bun.My hair is shiny, defined and set.  Once it's set, I apply Pantene's serum and I'm good for the entire week!  At night I put my hair in a high pony, during the day I release my hair, shake it out and that's it.  With the use of some cremes/custards, my hair can take 6 hours to dry.  The difference between this custard and a gel or mousse is that I get fabulous shine, hold and definition with no frizz and no flakes.  It's also very inexpensive and easily obtainable.  Good job, Pantene.  I'll be thrilled when amazon offers this product in bulk and hopefully, they'll add Pantene's Co-Wash, which is another fantastic product.;03 13, 2013;A3PNNB9MYO365A;L.

;B00AG27XJ8;[1, 1];4.0;"My quest to read more self-published books is mostly demonstrating to me that there is often no difference in quality between them and traditionally published books. In fact, in certain genres, it is much easier to find more ambitious or unusual books, of equal literary quality, in self-publishing.I am tempted to say that this middle-grade book is more ambitious than most, but recently middle-grade seems to be getting more ambitious, while YA, overall, is getting less so.It's divided into three timelines, which bleed into each other from fairly early on. In modern times, American Meredith is sent away from her beloved pregnant Lipizzan horse and her mother, who is recovering from cancer, to accompany her archaelogist aunt on a dig in Egypt. In ancient Egypt, Meritre, a singer in the temple of Amon, worries about her pregnant mother and the pharoah's daughter, who is sick with a mysterious plague. And in a cyberpunk future that has cured most diseases, Meru pursues her missing mother into a secret quarantine zone.This novel reminded me of a childhood favorite, Mary Stolz's ""Cat in the Mirror,"" which also contrasted dual timelines, of the same soul reincarnated in ancient Egypt and modern New York. Tarr's book is more complex and ambitious. The three timelines are not merely compared and contrasted and paralleled, but directly affect each other.The book starts a little slow, probably due to having to set up three plot lines rather than one, but becomes quite a page-turner by about the one-third mark. The themes are grief, times changing and times staying the same, the inevitability of death, and the equal inevitability of life going on: reincarnation, and birth, and life itself.Satisfying and complex.

The installation was uneventful, and my installer had no problems with any of the components or the instructions.We had some difficulty getting the system started.  Apparently the shipment was jostled a bit during transit, shaking some of the connections loose and keeping it from starting normally.  The staff at HighSEER was very helpful in resolving our problems, but the three-hour time differential between the installation and the distributor made communication slow.A competent DIYer could install the two control heads, but running the 230-volt electrical power and charging the refrigerant lines require more knowledge and equipment than most competent DIYers have on hand.  Installation requires drilling two three-inch holes in an outside wall, and I wasn't quite ready to do that myself, so I had the installer do the whole job.I gave the product four stars on the assumption that everything will work properly when we get the startup kinks worked out.  It's established technology, so it should.  Look for an update around October 10.October 12 Update:  We're still having some problems with the control logic on the second control head.  As long as I have only the primary head working, operation is perfect.  When I turn the second head on, it runs for half an hour and then the whole system shuts down on compressor overheat.  The HighSEER staff sent me a detailed technical manual, so we have a detailed troubleshooting flowchart to follow, but the going is slow.

Behind the Ear Sound Amplifier Super Mini Size Sound Enhancer;B00AIAKWAK;[3, 3];2.0;"May be worth 3 stars in it's price range, but not suitable for me for long term use. I bought it for the interim until my hearing restores itself or until I get a high grade hearing aid. I have reviewed thatB000FGTPUKand it got 1 star.This one is notably better than the $7 one in that when I set it at the appropriate level it has at least 10 times less static than the $7 model. Both of these products are moderately difficult to adjust the volume in fine increments. Both units can probably amplify to the point that a person with profound hearing loss can hear something. For moderate to something close to severe, they are way more than loud enough, but have narrow frequency responses and there has to be something worth hearing to be worth wearing either of them.They also amplify your own voice. It isn't too bad if it is set low enough to matter, but not to low or too high. A little to high will still make other voices better, but your own voice will be so loud it your own voice will annoy you. And this come from someone who frequently does public presentations and loves them!I'm going to be trying them at a conference. this is not the intended use or ideal situation for them, but hopefully will allow me to hear what I need to.I haven't tried the $30 or higher models of hearing amplifiers, but if they are much better than this it is worth the extra money, just as this is at least 3 times better than the $7 model.Hearing amplifiers are not hearing aids. comparing a hearing amplifier to a high tech hearing aid is like comparing elementary school baseball to major league baseball.If Amazon accepts returns on hearing amplifiers and you can afford it, I would try this and a $30 model and either keep one for a back up or return the one I like less. The $7 model is neither worth buying or going through the hassle of returning. It will be an emergency back up. This one will be a two month interim solution and only be used for very short amounts of time.Both this and the cheaper one use the same batteries which are exceptionally common. LR 44, 357 and about a dozen other ""types"" that are all the same size and voltage.I'm not complaining about either the $7 one or this one. They both fairly deliver what you paid for, and like the price, it isn't much.";10 25, 2013;A3J07P1U7TKK5P;Randy Abrams;Better than the $7 one, but not great.;1382659200

;B00AJEL71S;[1, 1];5.0;"Soothing piano melodies, an eco-conscious sensibility, pet-care and gardening metaphors frame this fantastical animated tale about the challenges of a new mother making a home for her family, raising bestial children with the readied resilience to find their place in a sometimes stormy world.By turns sprightly and melancholic as the story's sibling protagonists, this tender tribute to motherhood (comparable to the 1948 fictional memoirI Remember Mamastarring Irene Dunne) sparkles with a thoughtful script and organic scenery rendered tactile by CGI flourishes, while immersive vocal performances (Japanese/English) and the sentimental swell of its music inspire thankful tears for mothers everywhere.The narrative plays equally well at face value or by a deeper read of its allegorical layering (per review title). Mother Hana blooms with best intentions for her kids and a smile undeterred by adversity; it takes a village to nurture her garden, which she's advised won't grow up overnight. Daughter Yuki proves vibrant and capricious as the snow of her Japanese namesake; her drama involving a boy who lends his ear at school might just the same represent the vulnerability of baring any delicate secret of the heart. Younger brother Ame is as sullen as a rainy day, growing emotionally distant as a lone wolf toward adolescence, his senses tuned to the call of the wild. An overturned cradle of nestlings glimpsed in the woods resonates worryingly in the viewer's mind later again as Hana's litter prepare to leave the nest. Monsoon rains symbolic of life's hardships evoke the hazard of a storm sewer and river waters stirring earlier transformative events. The revisited image of a mountain photograph placed at the family hearth takes on new significance as the narrator reminisces about a supportive parent held tall in memory. The nomadic perspective of a pup left a less picturesque parenting experience is also scratched at.Anime regulars will recognize the influence of Miyazaki'sMy Neighbor Totoroin dabs that may feel too familiar -- wide-mouthed laughter, a child's eager exploration of a new backyard -- but this pensive film confidently asserts its own mature voice (or howl). Though perhaps suitable for ages 8+, the story really speaks to parents about grownup kids leaving home, delivered in lullaby notes heartwrenching and joyous.";05 1, 2014;A3AY0E2CEEAWXT;cyberfox29;"Children can be little beasts, or ""I married a Wolf-man"" (didn't we all!)";1398902400

Columbia Girl's Crash Out Jacket;B00AJOU5XY;[7, 7];5.0;"WARM coat and looks brand new despite several hard uses already.  I would buy this coat in my size!  Beautiful periwinkle blue on top and indigo below; my daughter loves it and so nice to have a break from pink.  Size XS is just a hair too big overall due to my almost 6 year old being on the delicate side (40lbs and ~37&#34; tall).  The only area that ever bothers her is at the chin with zipper fully zipped, it comes close to touching her nose instead of chin :) but that will no longer be an issue next season and we simply don't zip it up all the way.  The sleeves are also a tad long (no need yet for the Outgrown system) they have a nice taper to them and fit well over or under gloves.  She wears this with a thermal blend shirt & bottoms plus a lightweight polarfleece long sleeve and is very comfortable.  Powder skirt is well made and hits below natural waist.  Have used this coat heavily, skiing and rolling in the snow, sledding etc. 6+ times at Mt Baker and haven't found a thing wrong with it.  I am not sure if the hood fits over a ski helmet as she prefers the hood down.  Will update hood info next time we ski.

As far as the material goes, they're well made and i've worn them almost every day for a month now, they've broken in well.  There isn't much cushioning on the bottom so i did add insoles.

Top Moda Women Pack-72 Boots;B00AM481BO;[10, 15];4.0;Like the other reviews, definitely order a half size up! I'm a size 6.5 and I got a 7 and they fit snug. If you don't like them snug and want to wear thick socks, then order one full size up.I found the boots REALLY noisy when I walk, mainly because of the buckles jiggling in the back and the zipper handles constantly waving around. I ended up removing the buckles and putting hot glue in the opening in the zipper handle so it wouldn't move. I can still zip the boots open and close as long as I don't bend and lift the handle up. The other zipper handle that's there for decoration I just hot glued down to the zipper so it wouldn't move. Now they don't make any noise. That's just a personal preference, but if you don't like noisy shoes and have no problem making alterations to them to tone them down then I definitely recommend these boots. They're comfortable and cute and not bad for the price.I gave this a 4 star because of the noise, again personal preference, but other than that definitely recommend!;08 6, 2013;A2NRJI1DCOXV8N;Steph;Noisy;1375747200

;B00AMQWFOG;[0, 2];4.0;That's a Wrap is the third installment of Liz Borino's Mine series starring Steve Michaels and Zack Greene. Changes are ahead for this long established couple in both their private and professional lives. Their careers are up in the air when they learn their TV show is in jeopardy of cancellation due to low ratings. On the home front, Steve and Zack relationship is undergoing a few changes and news about Steve's mom brings an complication neither man expected.Steve and Zack's D/s relationship further evolves from the previous two books in the series. In Cutaway Steve's car accident offered Zack the opportunity to become a bit more dominant in their relationship. In That's a Wrap, this exploration is brought into the bedroom as they experiment with Zack in the dominant role and Steve as the submissive. Neither man wants to switch roles on a permanent basis but Steve discovers he enjoys giving up control in the bedroom on occasion.Another big area of change for Zack and Steve is the addition of Josh into their household. Steve and Zack are in a committed, monogamous relationship and that is not going to change. Instead, Josh is more of a domestic slave. Out of all of various story arcs, this one is the most underdeveloped. Zack and Steve begin the process of making Josh a permanent part of their household, but different events keep this plot simmering on the backburner.Steve's mom, Crystal, continues on a downward spiral. She plays a minor but very crucial role in That's a Wrap. I do not want to give anything away, but I will say that this storyline provides a new dimension to Zack and Steve's relationship.That's a Wrap is a wonderful addition to the Mine series. Liz Borino does a wonderful job keeping the story and Zack and Steve's relationship fresh. I am not sure if this is the final book in the series, but I know I would like to see where Zack and Steve go next in their personal and professional lives. I am also rather curious to see what happens next with Josh. That part of the storyline has an unfinished feeling to it so I am hoping there is another book in the works for him.I received a complimentary copy for review.;01 17, 2013;A3RHTYOGSITLWN;"K.

Mission Belt 40mm Men's Leather Ratchet Belt;B00AN7A84I;[3, 8];1.0;"I ordered two Mission Belts based on a friend's recommendation and positive reviews here on Amazon. I was a little skeptical of the size/gaudiness of the latching mechanism after looking at the online photos, but thought I would give one a try. When I first took the belts out of the box, my earlier suspicion was confirmed. The latching mechanism was just too big and heavy for my taste. Once again, I thought I might not be giving the belt a chance (too critical) and decided to at least try them on. That's what sealed the deal for me as far as definitely wanting to return them. The release mechanism works beautifully when the belt is not on you, or cinched up. Once you cinch the belt up and put a load on it, good luck fiddling around trying to get it to release. You must watch their online video in order to figure out how to get the belt released. Come on, it's a men's belt. We're not learning how to build an Excel spreadsheet; simply want to take a belt off! If you need to watch a video to take a belt off, there's something fundamentally wrong with the design. Bottom line, if you want to wear a belt for decoration, that has a BIG buckle and is difficult to take off, this may be the belt for you. I definitely would not recommend this belt to a friend. Do yourself a GIANT favor and check out the Slide Belt at [...] It's the same concept as a Mission Belt, but the buckle/latching mechanism is sooooo much nicer.

;B00ANFPSS6;[0, 0];4.0;12/08 - Just like another reviewer I tried countless times to win a GR giveaway for this book, but I was also unsuccessful. Thankfully I found this and its two sequels for $0.99 each on eBay, a fair price for a short, four star book. I liked Lark's physical strength, the way she could laugh at a young boy's offer to walk her home because she knew that no matter who she encountered she could look after herself. I was a little surprised at the hint of romance brewing between Lark and Raven, although now that I think about it I probably should have guess considering the number of romances Lee had listed in the GR giveaways. Lark's Quest had good-to-great dialogue and evocative descriptions, especially of Lark's Ariane uniform and her training routine. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series, it's just a shame all three books are so short, they have such promise they could easily have filled Tolkien or Paolini sized tomes and still left us wanting more.;09 24, 2013;A1HFBVC2S6VEY9;"Sarah Frost ""Sarah""";Good fantasy, just wish it was longer;1379980800

;B00AO72K4S;[0, 0];4.0;BROTHERS IN ARMS is a very good military MM romantic suspense.  I enjoyed this romance of two mature men and the military investigation that reunites them.Jonah and Kellan shared one night together before their military careers separated them.  Now an investigation in Iraq reunites them, if only they can live long enough.I liked this book a lot.  Unlike a lot of MM romance, this story isn't erotica with no story. Yes, Jonah and Kellan have an intensely erotic romance but most of the book takes place outside of their bedroom and to me this made their erotic interludes even sexier.  I also liked that Jonah and Kellan were both mature men with lives and experiences before and after they met.This book has an interesting plot with the investigation which combines the military and the FBI.  The mystery was written well and kept my attention.  I'm not familiar with the military so this world with all the acronyms and chain of command seemed exotic to me but still accessible as the author explained everything so someone unfamiliar like me can understand.I do admit though, that within the framework of the military and the mystery which turns into a kidnapping, Kellan and Jonah don't have the time to emotionally bond, or at least not where readers are privy to it.  I missed the emotional intimacy because the sexy romance was just on the cusp of this when the book ended.  It's my hope that the author will continue Kellan and Jonah's romance in forthcoming book.I recommend MM readers try BROTHERS IN ARMS for its strong storytelling and sexy romance with likable, mature characters.Reviewed by J9for TheRomanceReviews.com;06 6, 2013;A5JZNVV4TEAWU;"Carole &#34;The Romance Reviews&#34;";Strong storytelling and sexy romance;1370476800

;B00AP1OS8E;[0, 0];3.0;"Ignore the misspellings and grammar problems.  The book's premise is okay, but it suffers from certain flaws.  The clan's military operationsare interesting and exciting but,unfortunately, many pages are devoted to minor dialogue.  The main character, Bruce, is a survivalist who, to his credit, saves manypeople while combating overarching federal power and hooligan gangs.  Bruce, however, later becomes a warlord and ends up as some kind of mandarin.  The is a great deal of timespent on someone, usually Bruce, threatening to break legs, arms, faces, and so forth.  He has a short fuse and often launches off into vile, personal tirades against nearlyanyone.  On the other hand, he gets into a snit when he thinks someone has insulted his firearm.  Then too, the author appears to be preoccupied with testicles, because every few pagesthere are references to ""balls"".  The same is nearly true about parts of female anatomy.  In the midst of worldwide economic collapse and social disruption, the author spends pageson the subject of farting in bed!  Too much print is spent on the infant PJ, and how many people sleep in Bruce's bed.  Worse, the is some kind on metaphysical nonsense about the ""wave"",a kind of peak experience related to combat and semi-combat activities.  There are rules about this, you know.

;B00APBF8A6;[5, 30];1.0;I really wanted to like this game after loving 2 other Atlas games recently, but it was definitely not my thing.There is a fair amount of story, and it is typical anime fair.  It was written in 1997, so the premise is kind of funny/anachronistic.  I guess the internet and a connected city were futuristic back then.  The characters are 1 dimensional, and pretty dull.  The voice acting is top notch though.The gameplay really shows its age.  Released in 1997, you can expect pretty basic movements and dungeon quality.  Moving requires the use of the 3ds' crappy d-pad.  It is very very annoying,  especially after playing Persona 4 Golden.The art is Ok, but really blurry and low rez, especially during battles.  Part of the fun of these games is the monster design.  Again, Persona4 Golden on the Vita was great for that.  SMT: Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers on 3ds is really bad in this dept.Anyway, this game is definitely not for me.

Which is often the case with both pit orchestra and our amateur radio functions - various electrical and connector cords as well as ropes and guylines need to be visibly taped, sometimes to the floor and sometimes aerially where they could be nearly invisible thus hazardous.So far I have found its adhesive property impressive, using it in moist situations where in the past other tapes have failed.

I wrapped the tape around the top of the bottles and was able to use a hair dryer on high (this is a very hot hair dryer) to shrink the tape around the bottle lid.  Because it is tape, I could tape it around the bottle and then heat it up to shrink. Afterwards I was able to peel the tape off of the bottles easily with no residue.This tape is probably overkill for packaging boxes but for specialty uses it is excellent.;04 25, 2014;A22I55P15NSAOX;"Two kids mom ""scienceteachermom""";Excellent tape for specialty uses.

;B00AQKTI70;[1, 1];5.0;"This is the story of a family finding its footing in the wake of adultery and divorce, charmingly recounted by a highly intelligent 10 year old coming face to face with some of life's most challenging questions while loving cats and wearing elfin hats. Why do bad things happen to good people-- to Bible believing church attending Christians who practice their faith?  Why does God allow the faithful to undergo trials?  Why doesn't He do a better job of shielding them from adversity?  And is there such a thing as private sin, or do our individual actions impact the whole community?When a feral cat kills the young girl's  beloved cat Magi, she shouts: &#34; I hate Daddy and I hate Meany!&#34;  But as the story unfolds, she chooses to forgive, as one day she discovers Meany the murderous kitty half frozen under a bush, and saves his life.The author uses lush detail and rich layers of meaning to create a poignant experience for the reader .

GreatShield FUSION Series Shock-Proof SLIM Case for Apple iPhone 5 (Black);B00AQPKGNK;[7, 10];2.0;I bought this case a while back and recently got an email from Amazon requesting a review. I don't normally leave one but this product had none so far so I thought I'd share my frustration. The product is a hard shell thing, open at the sides to slip your phone in. Simple right? Well the second piece is the white rubbery cover for your phone. Here's the catch... Once the cover is on and you try to slip it in the case, the cover gets stuck and pulled off the phone and the case is just so that you can't adjust the cover after you put it in. Really annoying and looks like crap with the white rubber stretched and out of place. THEN when you try to remove it to attempt again, the phone is horribly stuck and it practically takes an act of God to get your phone back out. I even went to the manufacturers website to see if they told you how to put it on since the description here doesn't tell you jack, only to find that this product isn't even listed on their website!!! I tried a few more times and eventually the anxiety at the possibility that one time I might not be able to get my phone out without breaking the case was enough to make me give up. In other words, unless you love to be frustrated and enjoy having a case that must take a Masters degree in rocket science to put on, I would seriously consider a different case... The quality of the pieces is good, though... But that's pretty much it.;03 21, 2013;A20NIT16Z3AOQ;Micaela;Nice case but impossible to put on;1363824000

Cuisinart CYM-100 Electronic Yogurt Maker with Automatic Cooling, White;B00ARSC1MK;[88, 89];5.0;"Any review on yogurt makers tends to elicit comments on whether it's worth buying a machine at all so, here's the breakdown on the pros and cons:Machine vs. no machine - you can make spectacular yogurt either way. You can use of variety of methods, including crock pots, slightly warmed ovens etc. If you use yogurt as a starter, most brands that have live cultures in them do just fine.Greek yogurt - you can get creamy, rich yogurt that's so thick that you can stand a spoon up in it, either with or with out a machine. The factors that will help you do so all take place outside of any machine process. They are: raising and holding the milk initially to a higher temperature (I do 185 degrees for 10 minutes using a Pyrex measuring cup and the microwave)  using fuller fat milks (although 2 percent is almost as good as whole milk), and straining the finished yogurt. You can also use additives such as dried milk,if you don't mind the taste.Temperature and time to ferment - most electric yogurt makers seem to run at about 110 degrees and take about 6-8 hours. If you use a crock pot, oven or other method, it takes over 12 hours. Note: The Brod and Taylor bread proofer is the only one I've read about that allows you to vary the temperature, from 70-120 degrees. It is probably worth investigating if you are planning to make creme fraiche or kefir milk.Advantages of the CusinartYou can make batches of 50 oz., which is especially important if you are planning to make Greek yogurt, because the straining reduces the volume considerably. I do think that they should have made it a more convenient 2 qt. size; that's actually my only caveat about the device.It has a small footprint, is quiet, and frees up your oven, crock pot etc.Fast - 6 to 7 hours.Auto shut- off for the fermenting. (BTW, read the descriptions carefully for the inexpensive yogurt makers. I saw one review that indicated that some have a timer light, but don't actually shut the machine off. )Chilling, chilling, chilling - once the fermenting process is done, the machine automatically goes in to chilling mode. Depending on lifestyle, this is a big convenience. It's the only machine I've found that has auto shut-off and chill.You can make wonderful yogurt at home - so good luck with it! :)";09 1, 2013;A3HPJSVFRFIYFK;J.

I think what he writes about wife skills is correct. 100% true. And I like the stuff he has on how to avoid online players and find the DWERPs (read it and you'll find out!).

;B00ATK015K;[15, 16];5.0;"Hello. I'm posting this review to let everyone know that the new Blu ray of Luis Bunuel's TRISTANA is excellent both in quality as well as being complete. There is an extra feature of an alternate ending in which a few shots are different, but contrary to an earlier post, the ending on the main feature is exactly the same as when I saw this film at the NYFF & also in theatres. The image quality of this Blu ray is very film like and quite beautiful. In fact, I would say that watching this Blu ray is for me a revelation, bringing out facets of the film I had never noticed before. The image is a touch darker in a few interior scenes than when this film was released, but I don't find this to be a problem. In fact, the difference is so slight as to be a non-issue.In terms of the quality of Bunuel's film, rather than give my own opinion, I'll simply quote Alfred Hitchcock, who felt after seeing TRISTANA that Bunuel was ""the world's greatest living director"" and that he had never before seen ""such brilliant direction of actors"" in a film.I also must say that the extras on this disc are themselves worth the price of admission, in particular, a film long conversation between Catherine Deneuve and Kent Jones, about her career, her methods of expressing the characters she has played, and her memories of the directors she has worked with. In addition, there is a half hour conversation with Bunuelian scholar Peter William Evans on the struggle of Bunuel to make TRISTANA for over a decade in Spain, and a booklet that includes an essay by Richard Porton, fragments of Ms. Deneuve's diary written during the production of TRISTANA & an excerpt from Raymond Durgnat's book on Bunuel.";03 14, 2013;AM60FL5N41757;mark I.

;B00ATTCOXI;[2, 2];4.0;"Sherlock Holmes is contacted by the father of a young man who is missing and who may or may not be dead. A few months earlier father and son fought bitterly, and the son left home never to return. He also stopped going to work. There's no real proof one way or the other as to whether the young man is dead or not, but his ghost seems most determinedly to be haunting the theater where he worked before he disappeared...the theater owned by his father! Rumors that the young man may have committed suicide after being forced out of his father's house -- or perhaps may even have been murdered by his father -- are causing unrest among the theater employees. The father calls upon Holmes to figure out what happened to the son and reveal who (or even what) is doing the haunting.Sherlock Holmes pastiches either sound like the originals or they don't. Then, does the solution to the mystery depend on the inductive or deductive reasoning that Holmes always uses in canon, or is the author not able to work with that? And last (but certainly not least) the relationship of Holmes and Watson is either true to the originals or it is not.I think this story sounds quite close to the original language. It's a good murder mystery with an inventive plot and it is actually quite a bit more complex than I have made it sound in my concern about accidentally giving away the ending. Holmes uses true inductive and deductive reasoning to solve the case; the author handled that aspect most skillfully. The relationship of Holmes to Watson is quite accurate -- there's even the obligatory scene where Holmes must trick Watson lest the good Doctor give something away because he's such an open book!This is a better than average pastiche and well worth a read.";02 20, 2013;AOATR5ZLVCTDO;AcerAcer;The Case of the MelRoy Theater Ghost;1361318400

MIT ~ PRIVACY ~ 1PC for Goggle NEXUS 7 Tablet LCD Screen Protector Case Film Guard Skin Shield;B00AUB6CQU;[0, 0];4.0;"I am a little surprised.  For the price, this screen protector is great.As a privacy filter, it leaves a little to be desired.  I only say this because it only blocks viewing from left and right angles while in portrait mode.  It does it's job as well as any laptop privacy filter.  While personally I don't know that I believe this is 3M manufactured product; I like this product more than my 3M privacy filter on my 15"" laptop.The screen protector is very durable and sturdy (thick, without interfering with touch sensitivity).  It was easy to apply.  Just peal off the film on ""side 1"", line up the rigid plastic with the sides of the device and corners and let the film make contact with the clean tablet surface. It has a special coating so it bonds itself like a window cling, except without bubbles.  There's no sticky adhesive, and was easy to remove to realign.The privacy screen protector also resists finger prints (compared to the normal shiny tablet screen), and it also does not cause the screen to appear dimmer (as my laptop one does).I would purchase another one of these in the future.

;B00AVQ10BG;[0, 0];5.0;I see some people are complaining about spelling problem and whatnot in this book. I didn't care because the story was so well defined that I looked past them. This story had a love to tell about giving into your hearts desire. If you love someone just let them know and try and see how it works for you. Don't let lies and deceitful people get in the way of true happiness. If you have pain, share it with the one you love most. The couple in this story Kevin and Monica loved each other since forever. But still had to learn the hard way to surrender to it. Pam was an evil and deceitful trick who wanted everything and all of it. Her lies and hatefulness kept catching up to her, but she was slippery when wet and escaped them. Finally all good things come to an end and so did her evil deeds. In the end there is no love like the sweetest of forever love and Kevin and Monica learned that the hard way.

New Balance Men's ML574 Rugby Collection Running shoe;B00AVS2UTU;[6, 12];3.0;I've always loved New Balance 574's -- partly because of the look and style, but more because NB has large sizes and wide widths.

Sony BDP-S5100 3D Blu-ray Disc Player with Wi-Fi (2013 Model);B00AWKC0JM;[21, 21];4.0;"Pros: Quick setup, great picture quality, lots of appsCons: Menu screen is a bit too dark, BD player a bit noisyI've only had this player for a couple of weeks, but have played around with it quite a bit. I'll preface my review experience by saying that this is my first blu-ray player, so I have nothing to baseline it against.The player loads very quickly upon power up. Compared to the load time on my Oppo 971h DVD player, it's a race car. The picture and sound quality are top notch, as expected. I did not experience any glitches during playback and the 7.1 surround sound is truly immersive. The wifi setup was very easy and I was able to quickly download an update to the firmware and be up and running in a short time. There is a bit of a noise when using the physical disk (BD or DVD) as it spins even when you're not playing the movie. This was not much of an issue for me since my equipment is inside a cabinet.There are the typical selection of apps avaiable for streaming: Netflix, Amazon instant video, Youtube, Hulu+, Vudu, etc. I tried out Netflix first and the HD streaming was flawless, with no interruptions or lags. It does take about 20 - 30 seconds to load to actual app, but once you're in, there are no delays. I had a similar experience with Amazon. I'm a Prime member, so as soon as I logged in, I saw my saved items in the queue. There was a small delay with the Amazon app as I navigated through the choices and menus. Also, the Amazon user interface is actually more intuitive on the older Wii console.Pandora is another app I've tried and have gone through several playlists throughout the week. Again, like the Amazon app, I experience some delays here and there, but nothing too annoying. The songs however, seemed to play with no lag.The one area that is somewhat annoying is the menu and keyboard options. I'm hoping to remedy the latter with a USB keyboard, but for now, I have a reasonable solution. I've installed the TV SideView app on my iPad (it's also available in the Google Playstore). Using the app, I can quickly search for titles, play movies, music, etc. much faster than wading through the menus with the remote.As I mentioned before, the menu seems a bit dark and scrolling through the huge list of apps for video and audio is not ideal in the current arrangement. I've also experienced some sub-menus that don't display a &#34;back&#34; or &#34;return&#34; button. It appears as if you're stranded at the end of some menu. You are forced to hit the &#34;Home&#34; button to get back to the main menu.The physical size of the player is rather small, which is nice if you're fighting for room in your electronics cabinet. It is somewhat difficult to stack another device on top of it since it has that prism design, but I still managed to get the Wii console and my ATT Uverse box on top of it. The build quality seems rather cheap for a player that's supposed to be a flagship model.Overall, I'm very pleased with this device so far and I'd say it's a solid contender.

"ReadeREST Original Stainless Steel &amp; Clear Crystal Twin Pack";B00AWU3OGK;[0, 0];5.0;These glasses holders are amazing and so much better than I expected!  I use the stainless on a daily basis and the crystal when I go out.  For me, the best place to put them is on my shoulder, which is a little strange but works nicely.  I put my glasses in so the lenses face my blouse to protect them.  The magnets are wonderfully strong--I can take off my blouse with them attached, and they don't even fall off.  The back oval is strong also and can be moved to be perfectly straight across after I put it on my blouse.  My biggest problem has been remembering to move the holder from one top to the next, so I am  ordering a couple more so I don't have to move it from my good clothes to my work clothes to my nightgown.  This is WAY better than losing my glasses or hanging them around my neck!!;07 20, 2014;A2LIWS0TJOGZ5Z;crazydogs;Amazingly strong, work perfectly everytime;1405814400

Braun Silk Epil Female Epilator Se7921spa 1 Count;B00AX3YNPC;[0, 0];4.0;I've tried really hard to make myself like this product better.  I have a less advanced version of it, and I loved the idea of the spa skin treatment as an add-on.  And that part of this is great!  The brush does a super job, and my skin feels wonderful after using it.  It would almost be worth having for that alone.  However, I still can't quite get the hang of the hair removal.  I've used every suggestion I can to reduce pain, but it still hurts a fair amount, and also I have trouble getting all the hair quite as well as I'd like to.  It works best on my legs, and hurts less there too, but under my arms?  That's painful, and stays so for a while.  I don't think that's anything particular to this model.  It's more just the nature of the beast.  I do love the light---I can't see how it would even be possible to use without that helping see what I've gotten or not!I'd base my decision on whether to buy this on whether you like this type of hair removal or not.  If you do, this is a well designed model, it looks nice, it has the brush feature and the light---it's a quality product.  But if you've tried other epilators and found them painful or hard to use, I don't think you'd find this one any different in those features!;05 15, 2013;A3DFH4CKPIT0N9;Suzanne Amara;I love the spa part---the epilation part?

Braun Silk Epil Female Epilator Se7921spa 1 Count;B00AX3YNPC;[0, 0];4.0;"Apparently Braun has made some improvements since I last tried a Braun Silk Epil 2 or 3 years ago.  That experience was so painful I went back to using Nair on my sensitive skin.Fast forward to January 2013 and I tried a Panasonic epilator ES-WD94-PPanasonic ES-WD94-P Compete Ladies Wet or Dry Epilator Set, White/Pink(seems to be no longer available here) which caused me so little pain I have continued to use it on a regular basis. In addition to being the least painful epilator I've used, it has a foot buffer head similar to the Emjoi Micro-Pedi.While this Braun SkinSpa has made great strides over older models in producing the least amount of pain while you are essentially ripping your hair out by the roots, it's still not quite on par to my Panasonic, but it's very close and has similar features such as being a wet/dry epilator, the light so you can see the hair, the running time before it needs recharged, and easy clean-up.My favorite part of this Braun is the exfoliating brush. I tend to use my old Panasonic for epilating and buffing my heel calluses. But this brush-head on the Braun takes my rough, dried up winter skin to a whole new level of smoothness; additionally, it somehow helps relieve the slight irritation after epilating.";04 5, 2013;A3CG93783LP0FO;"Yarii ""fifty shades of blonde""";The brush is my favorite feature;1365120000

;B00AXI9WFS;[16, 25];1.0;I was looking forward to Disney Inifinity but I am very disappointed. I will attempt to get a refund. I had to restart the game for Pirates because a cutscene didn't happen on Sipwreack Shoal so the game wouldn't progress. Then two story line missions disappeared from my list but since it was the second time through I knew how to proceed to get the gold stars and subsequent missions. Unfortunately it just happened again in Monsters and I am lost. Disney is responding to my emails but it is obviously they aren't being read thoroughly and they are offering no suggestions.Even if this game didn't have glitches I find that limited directions are given. I didn't have a clue what to do when the game started in the Toy Box and the instructions for vehicles like bikes in the play sets only stay for a few seconds the first time the bike is placed. If I wanted to see them again I needed to quit and restart.Comparing this game to Toy Story 3 isn't accurate. TS3 had levels in a story mode. Infinity play sets are more like the Toy Box in TS3. I haven't play in toy box mode in infinity so I'm not sure what that is like but Toy Story 3 was a much better game.IMO this game is completely about merchandise and not about game play;09 1, 2013;AP88SPRV4H4L0;Andrea L Pappalardo;Too many glitches;1377993600

;B00AXI9WFS;[2, 3];3.0;"First off, playing in the Toy Box is a lot of fun. My kids have set up their own worlds, downloaded Disney's worlds, and with their characters and what-not, they have a blast.The &#34;stories&#34; that you play, however, are chock-full of bugs that make playing very tedious. Occasionally, the game puts you into situations where you cannot beat that particular mission. The only recourse is to start over. It's quite frustrating. It's sad, too, because the levels are pretty fun all by themselves when they work. When they don't, it's pretty evident that the product needed a lot more testing and bug fixing before it got released.In short, it's a neat concept. Because of the emotional tie of the characters and movie story lines, it can be very fun. The bugs just really detract from gameplay.";09 11, 2013;A33O3N35S7L7PC;D.

The Toy box mode is where the fun is at, so make sure to check that mode out. Tons of things to find (eggs) and tons of areas to explore. The graphics are excellent as well.

MACBETH Men's Brighton Shoe,Dark Grey/Medium Grey,6 M US;B00AZGHK2U;[0, 0];3.0;"I bought this shoe at another site in red. Macbeth has a reputation of fitting like other shoes one size smaller. However, if you can, try to find a store nearby that has the same model shoe and try it out yourself. I wear an 11, ordered a 10.5. It's a little too snug with the soles, perfect without. One bad thing about this shoe that I really wish they didn't do was make it with a small toe box (front end of the shoe). It's a lot more narrower than your average shoe. Other than these, it's a great deal. Vegan friendly. Seems to be made of quality material. I think, if you find a deal on these you can't resist, if you play on using the soles, order the same shoe size as you would for any other shoe, if you don't want the soles, up to one size smaller is okay, but that's the max. If you don't want your toes feeling the friction on each step, just look at another shoe. It's hard to tell from pictures, but once I got them, the front end are fairly pointy compared to average shoes. Not sure if many Macbeth models are like this, but there's no reason to settle for these kind of shoes. Might not be the biggest deal for most people, but I recently read quite a bit about what proper shoes should have. Look up what proper running shoes have, or rather don't have: supports. These shoes are rather flat except for the inner arch supports. One really important thing for proper walking/running and stability is a roomy toe box to emulate bare foot walking as much as possible. If you're nit picky about proper orthopedics but still are willing to wear &#34;casual (non-specialized) shoes,&#34; look else where.";06 13, 2014;A1ROY29K6Y16Z2;Punkster Brew;Gorgeous shoe, but care when ordering shoes online;1402617600

He has taken the First Lady and sullied her reputation to the tenth degree.  Put a crack pipe in her mouth and made you respect the crack more than the woman.  He has given the reader an inside look into the hood and allowed them to ride along and experience the crack addiction and it's devastation.

It's kind of expensive per piece set, @ .12 per piece but it does have some very special pieces in it.  It's also very large, very large.The set has a lot of vehicles to up the piece count, they are fun.  And complete the loading of the plane.  It's a very cool set.  My son loves it.Two things I don't like about the set.- First the mid section of the plane right where the wings connect it's used for anything.  It's not accessible, it's a waste of space.  They could have designed some way to put freight there.- Second The top of the wings is very bare.  They are a huge, I mean huge piece.  and it's all bare.  It would have been nice to have some contour to them.As always though the Lego design amazes.  I love the transition from white to green.  (it's a sticker) but still very very cool.  I love the nose of the plane.  The precision of the pieces is awesome.As an adult I love the set.  My son, will play with this for days.

;B00B0N10IC;[1, 1];5.0;"This is wall to wall intense stuff, and if it's ""not your thing"" to do in depth meditations and energy healing work on yourself then you may not get into this book.  There is absolutely no fluff here at all, with important information throughout.  Some of which was new to me, as I have been studying this realm for only around 8 years but still!  I myself found myself skipping over the meditations when I read this  the first time, because they seemed overwhelming to me at first being so many, and being that they were very in depth.  My guides reminded me that this was the main reason I was drawn to this, I of course ended up not only doing them but also making a detailed outline of them all for easy reference.  (Something I recommend you do if you do the work.)  It's highly worth it if you are so inclined, the meditations are incredible and powerful!Update 3/5/2014: The healing work laid out in this book is mindblowingly powerful.(You can do self healing with a Higher Being as well.)  I plan on recommending this book to my clients as appropriate,and would be completely honored and humbled to use the work Sufian channeled with my own clients for their healing as appropriate.

;B00B0N10IC;[2, 2];5.0;When I saw this book recommendation on my tablet, I immediately felt a very powerful desire to read it.Part One of this book reads like the poetic tale of a very talented storyteller on the path to Enlightenment. I loved it!Part Two and the first chapter of Part Three are very technical and, in my opinion, are mostly intended for energy healers and those wishing to further their healing abilities, which requires a lot of time and discipline. For that reason, I would have preferred that the exercises be gathered as an appendix at the end of the book.Starting with Chapter 11, Part Three is mind-blowing! I have read a great number of books on spirituality and wish to say that a lot of the material in Part Three and, to a certain extent, in Part One has been a revelation to me. I do believe that Sufian Chowdhary, among many others, has incarnated in order to help those that are ready reach a higher level of spiritual evolution.;11 13, 2013;A3RD086ZTB9MUH;Suzannah_M;Enlightening!

This vendor is not honest and does not provide even marginal customer service or support.

;B00B1OWEVC;[2, 4];5.0;As a fully-realized work, this first album by HTDA is as effective as a Reznor project since the colossal 'Downward Spiral'.  It is the apotheosis of sonic elements and approaches Reznor and Co. has been experimenting with for at least the past five years, since 2008's 'Ghosts I-IV'.But, when you call yourself 'How To Destroy Angels' you better be bad-ass or risk looking silly.  So there is enough doom, gloom, and repudiation of religion to fit the bill on this album, so don't you worry.  Reznor & Co. are staying aloof, laying down the advanced electronic approaches of modern 'rock'.  Hiding behind the pixellations and the muffling filters. Cranking out the glitch.  Making mistakes on purpose.The arc of 'Welcome Oblivion' explores big themes: Eternity. Cycles of creation and destruction. Impermanence. The tension between loneliness and introversion. As well as the familiar themes of destruction, apocalypse and hate.Within the familiarity, Reznor & Co. do break new ground.  The song that strays most from Reznor's orthodoxy is 'How long?' which is really the only fully realized 'song' in the pop sense.  It features a bass line that could have been played by Peter Hook. It's a back to the future 80s moment taking us to an alternate reality where Sascha Konietzko replaces Bernard Sumner in New Order. In a sense, this is exactly what he was trying to achieve with his debut album, Pretty Hate Machine.It's this song where the masks come off, or more like around 'Too Late, All Gone'. The album builds up to these tracks and tapers off gradually, and they even announce it in the track 'We Fade Away'.  The gloves are off.  We're seeing the artist staring us in the eyes showing us his tricks.  But we're bitten anyway. It's a series of strings and attractors leading us from one track to another. We find ourselves at the destination with golden ticket in hand, but... sadly the factory is shuttered and Dr. Frankenstein is busy inside replacing Wonka's brain with drum machine innards.Reznor has always been known to take a sonic scalpel to slice songs to bits, reassemble them and mesh layers of elements like some industrial-pop mad professor. His recent collaborations have proven fruitful as he has loosened his work style to include other perspectives.  The advancement is evident here, as the tracks have a natural flow and mature development.  More organic.  Less exercises of dominance and submission.Reznor has cultivated a strong artistic integrity and thematic consistency that is not moved by fashion. With HTDA he's brought in the closest of collaborators and others who share his vision.  As such, this is a very strong album.  Compare this work to Atoms for Peace's recently released first album, another vision of apocalypse, and a collaborative album by a 90s survivor, and you can hear the difference between amateur-ish wannabe, bleep and bloop artists and true purveyors of fine electronic music.;03 16, 2013;A1MV4I024S3THB;J.

Fusion Contigua Straight Non-Locking Gate Carabiner;B00B1PDOH4;[0, 0];4.0;Not as shiny as the picture, more of a matte finish. A little thicker and bigger than a normal carabiner keychain. Quality is really nice, it does look like it could be used for climbing but I just wanted to have a nice keychain. My old dollar one's color has completely rubbed off so I wanted a nicer one. My old one is still going strong.Originally used the Nite-Ize S-biners but my keys fell off a few times and the carabiner itself fell off my belt loop too. So I tossed it and just put my keys in a bag. Then went to an arcade and won a few tickets so I got a carabineer keychain. Those cheap dollar ones and to my surprise, held my keys and never fell off my belt loop. So now I like using carabiners as keychains.It's a good price for a well made and neat looking product. I like the idea that if an emergency occurred, it could be used in a pinch. Not a survival expert so don't know what for.;06 27, 2014;AH5LRUAFO44F0;Yuen K. Wong;Nice product;1403827200

In some cases it may not be honey at all but sugar water with other sweeteners and flavorings. But China is notorious for getting around this restriction by exporting its honey to other countries which then supply US markets (honey laundering) through lax FDA and vendors who don't care.

;B00B4Y2ODW;[0, 0];5.0;"It might be too short, but then I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d ever have my fill of Payson and Land.  I&#8217;d love for her to write several books with them in it.  I don&#8217;t know if she studied up on hyenas or she just naturally understood their personality, but Payson matches them to a tee.  I used to know a hyena , he was owned by a small zoo I helped out with, and I loved the little guy and spent much of my time talking to him and scratching him behind his ear. I loved his laugh and yes, I know they are wild and scary at times, but I never forgot this one and I've  always loved hyenas since then.Payson is like that , he wants to be loved, but he can be erratic and you need to be calm around him because you never know what he&#8217;s going to do.If they took land, if someone hurt land, Payson would lose it.  I guess that&#8217;s why I like this book because it could be a opener to what could come, we just need to nudge the writer a tad and maybe ask please can we have some more.";05 10, 2014;A2J85WKOC6C2O3;catspaws;I love the characters;1399680000

;B00B5KCK0M;[3, 3];4.0;"Read more of my reviews and ramblings at Ana's Attic Book Blog4.5 Sexy Stars!Eden Summers is an author from Australia who asked me to review her book, Concealed Desire. I had no idea what to expect at all was was so happy that it turned out to be a GREAT read! I loved this book! It was a quick, hot, happy romance that actually had a great HEA! No Cliffhanger!!!! YAY!This book actually has almost everything I look for in a book. It has a totally hot alpha, romance, steamy sex, humor, sexy banter, a little angst, an HEA and a great epilogue. It took place in Melbourne, but it honestly could have been Melbourne FL...it didn't seem like it was written outside of the USA (damn, no kangaroos or koalas or anything). This is how I felt while reading it. (See the blog for gifs)Beth is propositioned by her much, much older boss. Disgusted, since she had looked at him as a father figure, she doesn't know how to answer, and says she needs the weekend to think about it. She then proceeds to go down to the bar and drink herself silly. Complicating the issue more, is that it was the wrong Sutherland who propositioned her. She had had the hots for the boss's player son since a drunken kiss the previous year. But Beth is NOT a player, and casual sex isn't her thing. She doesn't want to get her heart involved and then get dropped like a hot potato. After getting a little too drunk, she is rescued. This time, by the right Sutherland boss, Dean, who takes her home, fighting the urge he has to take advantage of her drunken state. He's wanted her just as long as she him.""Beth shamelessly stared at Dean the entire trip home....His tentage was damn impressive. The elevation alone could shelter a family of five""He was a gentleman when she was drunk, though it took all the self control he had. But this time he wasn't going to let her go again, he waited until she was sober and went in for the kill. Lets just say. His tongue is talented.""You what? You want my mouth back on your sweet p****?"" He raised his eyebrows. ""You want me inside you? You want me to make you scream again?"" um......yes please.When Dean's father shows up at her house to reiterate his offer, Beth decides that Dean is using her, and pushes him away. But he stands firm, convincing her to spend the day with hime with one rule. No sex.""Who was she kidding? She couldn't turn down more time with Dean. She already wanted to lick a trail from the muscular join of his hips--or cum-gutters....all the way up to his dark red nipples."" (best expression ever!)""She wasn't sure Captain Copulation could agree to a no-sex rule without his manhood shriveling away.""""Unless you plan on begging,"" she whispered with a curve to her lips.""I'm not too proud to beg. For you.""But that didn't stop her from accompanying him home while he showered...and she watched. Holy moly, after reading that shower scene, I needed a cold shower myself!Likes:-Tons of funny little one liners and banter.-Dean has a good alpha streak, especially in the bedroom.-The story was told in both points of view (but in 3rd person).-I smiled the whole time.-I loved Dean!-I wanted to punch Beth a little, and smack sense into Dean--all marks of a good story.-It had everything I love in a book.-Great epilogue.-Use of expressions like ""baloney pony"" and ""thrill drill"".Dislikes:-Way too short for the price.Rating: 4.5 stars, 4.5 HeatI went into this knowing nothing about the author or the book, and I'm so happy I took a chance and read it! I never would have if the author had not contacted me. While this may not be the most memorable book for me, it was such a satisfying read from start to finish, despite it's length, that it is one I will re-read in the future. I highly recommend this one!*Special note: In this book, Beth is given some advice by her best friend that I wish every stubborn heroine in every romance book could hear:""Now I know you're hurting and I also know you have doubts. You aren't entirely convinced that he's done something unforgivable. You're just too hurt and insecure because of his reputation to get the facts.""";03 18, 2013;A203QQMJRIN721;Ana's Attic;4.5 Stars for this Fun and Sexy Read;1363564800
;B00B5KCK0M;[0, 0];5.0;Concealed Desire is one of those books that has it all. Heart, humor and heat. Not only is Ms. Summers writing style honest and realistic but her main characters Beth and Dean are too. I read this book in one sitting as I just couldn't put it down. It truly was that good and that engaging. Often in books, the chemistry and feelings  between characters feels forced and fake...not the case here. The interactions between Beth and Dean are well written and authentic. The pacing and conflict(and the resolution of it)are well done and also believable. Also another strong point about this book is that Beth and Dean both are aware of and admit to their own actions having played a part in the conflict.

Venta Airwasher Humidifier LW15 GREY;B00B5PKHLG;[16, 17];5.0;This is my third Venta Humidifier so I'm clearly a huge fan.  My other two are the largerVenta Airwasher Humidifier LW45 WHITEmodels.I've been though several types of humidifiers and every other one had serious drawbacks.  Ultrasonic humidifiers leave a fine white dust.  Swamp-cooler (fan blowing on sponge) humidifiers get moldy which is the opposite of what I want to blow into my air.On the other hand, Venta is advertised as an Airwasher which implies that it cleans the air.  In fact, it really does.  If you fill the filter with clean water and check on it before it runs out you'll see that the water is dirty.  The dirt came from the air.Others have reported problems with their Ventas clogging up with mineral deposits.  I haven't had that problem sine the water here isn't too bad in that regard.  Venta sellsVenta Airwasher Venta Water Treatment, 35oz Bottleto help prevent this but for me it didn't make any noticeable difference.I clean mine periodically with white vinegar and a toothbrush.  I wouldn't put it in a dishwasher like some users suggest since the plastic might melt.My only minor complaint is that sometime the lid's motor and the water wheel don't engage the first try so you have to do a visual inspection to make sure it's actually working after you add water.  Other than that, this product is built to last out of high-quality materials.I think this is the best humidifier on the market.;12 3, 2013;A3F3B1JPACN215;Michael G.

;B00B5UGUNA;[0, 0];5.0;Been through the book and keep it handy for going back through.  I found it pretty much up to date. Bookmarked sites that I applied to so I could keep track.  Not saying that I've been successful at gaining enough self employment from it to pay the bills but I'm working toward that goal.  I believe it's do-able.  However, the market for work from home jobs is becoming, if not already, rather saturated.  Just my humble opinion.  I'm not competitive enough to desire applying where 20+ people have already applied and then have to wait 30+ days for results.  I'm referring to a single handful of WAH sites, not all of them.I was also surprised by the amount of companies out there vs my own efforts over the last few years of finding virtually very little.  This was a good investment for that reason as well.I'd highly recommend the book.  Just a word of advice:  Don't just apply at one place.  Put yourself out there on a number of them because it might be a long wait before you hear back.  If you're working at one place and it's not enough, set yourself up with another company or more.Good luck!;03 24, 2014;A22ATC6IYYECOY;KNairn;Lots of good info;1395619200
;B00B5UGUNA;[1, 1];5.0;In an economy of increasing unemployment, this is a necessary read. It includes a database of 460 companies that currently use stay-at-home workers, with all of the companies categorized according to job type. Each is presented with a brief description of its overall function as well as the job requirements for would-be employees. For some jobs, the book also provides the approximate pay rate offered.One of the things I particularly liked about this book is its organization. There are some kinds of jobs I simply wouldn't be interested in (or wouldn't do well at), so it is nice to have a book that allows me to skip directly to the sections that are more of a fit for my education and personality type.As a work-from-home individual myself, I have found this book very helpful, and I plan to recommend it to several of my relatives who need something like this, too.

;B00B6T4ME4;[3, 4];5.0;I'm a self-confessed information junkie when it comes to preparing for my fantasy drafts. I usually draw upon a half dozen sources of information each year, and I always seek out at least one 'new' source of information.  This year I found the Fantasy Black Book. I came away impressed.First of all, I love the fact that the information isn't presented in over-simplified lists of players. The players are broken into categories - elite, top talent, solid options, up and coming, red flags, don't believe the hype, etc. - that allow you to weigh risk vs. reward in your own way, rather than relying on a list-maker choosing for you (ie are you willing to call Edwin Encarnacion and Chase Headley top-5 choices at their position?).And, like I said, I'm a stathead.  I enjoyed learning the RPV (Relative Position Value), and plan to try it out this year on a small scale to see how it correlates to my own rankings. It's a great way to quantify the differences in value between an Adrian Beltre at 3B vs., say, Mark Teixeira at 1B.I'll be sure to look for the Fantasy Black Book 2014 edition when preparing for next year's season.;01 28, 2013;ATIVYUW8BEG69;The I.C.;More than your typical rankings;1359331200

;B00B73H3K4;[0, 0];5.0;This is hands down my favorite book in the series!  Livie Cleary has spent her life trying to be perfect and please everyone including her deceased parents.  Livie heads off to college on her own and meets Ashton, the captain of the row team and most handsome man whore at the school, at her first college party.  There seems to be an attraction on both sides, but Ashton is constantly blowing Livie off.  What Livie doesn't understand is why.  And when she asks around about him, we find out that no one really knows anything about Ashton.  What is this guy hiding?Apparently he's hiding a whole lot and it was never anything I saw coming.  You might start out hating his smirking and cocky attitude but give him time and trust me you will fall in love with me.But will Livie still like Ash when she finds out about his secrets?This is a story about two characters that are just trying to figure out who they are and want to break away from what is expected of them and find their own path in life.So beautifully written, I will never get tired of rereading this one!;06 24, 2014;A1H143AB8WKIJL;Amanda R;Favorite book in the series!;1403568000

;B00B73H3K4;[0, 0];5.0;As Seen Through My Specs review *ARC provided by NetGalley for an honest review.*I've been looking forward to this story, as you may or may not know K.A. Tucker's Ten Tiny Breaths was my favorite, number one book I read in 2012, the tops out of 396 books, so I had great expectations, but I was also worried about the sophomore slump... no need to worry, this book was just as amazing.  Many thanks to Netgalley who provided me with a galley version in exchange for an honest review.We pick up the story some time after life with Kasey has settled down, and now it's time to follow Livie's story.  She's grown up, finished high school and is on her way to Princeton, to fulfill her life long dream of being a doctor, and helping kids fight cancer.  Dr. Stayner is still involved in the girls' lives and challenges Livie to embrace freedom and college life, to taste it all.College is a wild and crazy place, I should know, I work at one.  This life is shell shocking to our little Livie who has been a shy reserved girl her whole life, repressed really in so many ways.  In bringing her to Princeton Kasey makes it her mission to help her sister live life more fully, to walk on the wild side, so she and Livie's new roommate Reagan drag our sweet girl off to party.The party is a pivotal time in Livie's life, she gets crazy drunk and mayhem ensues, and of course she meets the campus bad-boy, Ashton.  There is the inevitable morning after, hangovers, tattoos and a nickname, Livie is now Irish.  Although fascinated by this bad-boy he's got a girl back home and a hundred others in his room, so not what Livie needs.  He isn't her picture of her future and happiness but she does meet the perfect part of that picture Connor, who happens to be Ashton's roomie and bestie.  You could palpably feel the awkwardness of it all.Through classes, and parties and volunteering Livie struggles to figure out who she really wants and needs to be.  Connor is perfect, and the perfect boyfriend, but there's something about Ashton, something running deep which draws Livie to him time and again.K.A. Tucker weaves a beautiful tale of Livie's coming of age and figuring out who she is and who it is she wants to be.  It is a wild and emotional ride and I couldn't put it down.  Pick it up, I'm positive you will love it.  Kudos K.A., another amazing story.;06 11, 2013;AVDMJG6RHVOOM;Melanie;Visceral and real, another emotional view into the lives of this family;1370908800
;B00B73H3K4;[1, 1];5.0;I loved the way the author told the story of Ashton and Livie.  Their instant attraction and the friendship that developed was beautiful despite the darkness in their past (and the significant others that they both were committed to).  There were many common themes that you find in the typical new adult romance stories that are so common and yet this story was far from common.  The author did an amazing job of making the reader feel the characters a little deeper and draw you in with the bonus of humor and just the right amount of steam factor. This story still was able to claim its own brand and stand out as a winner.  I highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good young adult romance novel.;06 22, 2013;A1N7N05ZQEH8TD;Romance addict;This will be an all time favorite of mine!;1371859200

TEKwriterUSA Gelwriter Gel Pen Set with Pop-up Case, 100-Count (27104-D);B00B80SOUE;[0, 0];5.0;There are great gel pens.The pens write smoothly, like most gel pens, and they are water- and fade-resistant and contain acid-free archival ink. Such qualities are important to those of us who like to do artwork, journaling, sketching with them. They are non-toxic, a good feature since kids will like to use these pens too. Also, they're safe to use on checks (but realize that some colors may not read well when checks are deposited via ATM machines). Best to use dark inks for that.In this set you get 8 basic pens (0.7 mm), 16 pastel pens (0.8 mm), 12 neon pens (0.8 mm), 34 metallic pens (0.8 mm), and 30 glitter pens (1.0 mm)--a versatile set for people who journal and who like to decorate their pages. Or for those who just like to write or take notes with several colors.I tested out several of the pens for water resistance and found that it is important to let some of them dry a bit longer than others. In other words, the drying time is quick, but it varies a bit with the different colors. So, arts and crafts people, if you plan on applying any water or moisture over the ink, it's best to wait a few extra seconds to assure that the ink is good and dry.The revolving tray is a nice touch. You can easily turn it to select the color you want. Another nice feature is the comfortable grip on each pen.Overall all an excellent value.Highly recommended for those who like gel pens.;04 24, 2013;A1NS6O584WD5FJ;William Polm;Lovely colors, good value.;1366761600

;B00BAF05BI;[2, 2];4.0;'Consumed' by Matt Shaw is a book that he wrote that unlike his other books focuses on over the top gore and gross out elements mixed with humor like the classic slasher films of the 70s and 80s.The premise is simple. A group of young people get stuck in a remote area while attempting a weekend getaway. They are offered help by a family who aren't quite city folk to put it mildly. From there things just start getting going into full gear. While there is a lot of gore and sex in this short tale, it does not go as overboard as Edward Lee does in his books. There is just enough to make you say 'ugh' without being over the top.The characters are pretty well detailed for a short story, which is a nice change from other books I have read. Also I am hoping that maybe there might be another novella featuring some of the characters in this book as the ending does leave the possibility of the author doing so if he chooses.A good read. Contains gore and other 'gross out' elements, but then that is why you would read this book. Mixed with a sense of humor as well, really this book is worth getting.;04 15, 2013;A33SX0AD5PYD9B;Kortick;really great short gory horror comedy;1365984000

;B00BB30BHW;[0, 0];5.0;As a minor history buff Russian history has always fascinated me. Tolstoy's epic novel (he didn't like to call it a novel apparently, but more his philosophical thoughts and understanding of the times) is surely fascinating giving readers of today a firm insight into pre-revolutionary Russia and although he pretty much ignores the proletariat he does give fascinating insights into the grand lifestyles of the aristocracy.I read the tome in my twenties and now again 50 years later and this time enjoyed it much more I think. I must admit I skipped through many of the the last pages as it dealt with Tolstoy's endless explanations of the politics of life in the early 19th century and his understanding and explanations re the Russian defense against the French invasion.We readers today seem to need fast-paced situations to enjoy a novel because we live in a fast-paced world with all the technology at our finger tips however up to 50 years ago reading was pretty much the only sedentary activity one could indulge in so they had a lot of patience and interest in details and pages upon pages of descriptive narrative and written in the 1880s (I think) it's no wonder Tolstoy's efforts were considererd among the finest.;05 31, 2014;ATUY2V0LUDES7;Rick;Great Novel if you like Russian and Napoleonic history.;1401494400

Remington AQ7A WetTech Rotary Shaver with Lithium Technology;B00BB5YFEU;[1, 1];5.0;"The new Remington AQ7A shaver has some major improvements over the olderR-5130 modelwhich I rated only ""okay"".It certainly functions well enough as a razor, producing a close shave and leaving the skin smooth and unabraded. Shaving with a rotary razor requires a different technique than with other types&mdash;go over the same area several times in little circles and pull the skin taut if there are tight curves or wrinkles.  Only minimal pressure is required and there is no pulling or pain. The blades don't touch the skin so they don't scrape it and the likelihood of ingrown hairs is reduced.  Being able to use this shaver in the shower with shaving gel is a major advantage.The redesigned handle is significantly less bulky and fits very comfortably in the hand.  The cobalt-blue soft touch plastic has a nice feel and combined with the well-placed ridges, gives a good grip when used in the shower.  The scalloped base hints that this version can be used in the shower and rinsed for cleaning although it shouldn't be submerged in water.  The overall appearance is attractive.The button that opens the blade compartment has been redesigned so that it is less likely to be pressed accidentally.  The blades and the blade mechanism are the same and although they require some care in cleaning and are expensive to replace, they last a long time.The battery charges quickly and the motor isn't noisy.  It comes with a recharging stand with a non-slip base which is handy because the shaver just slips right in and stays charged rather than requiring that the plug be manually inserted in the base for recharging.  There is a blue LED to show the battery is charging and a red LED to show when the charge is low.  The battery on the older model lasted a little over two years using it two or three times a week but it was a nickel-metal hydride type and this new model has a lithium-ion battery which I am hoping will last longer.This is a good choice in a rotary shaver with a very functional and attractive design and it gives good results used wet or dry.";05 4, 2013;A1UQBFCERIP7VJ;Margaret Picky;Rotary electric wet shaver;1367625600
Remington AQ7A WetTech Rotary Shaver with Lithium Technology;B00BB5YFEU;[1, 1];4.0;"The Remington AQ7A razor currently replaces an older-model Remington rotary-style electric shaver. In the package is the razor itself, a charging cradle/cord, a small cleaning brush and a plastic ""waterproof"" mirror for use in the shower.I have been using electric razors of various styles for many years now and my impressions of the Remington AQ7A are generally favorable. This razor replaces an older model Remington rotary-style shaver.While it is generally understood that an electric razor will not provide as close of a shave as a standard razor will, I found the AQ7A to perform as well (or a bit better actually with the benefit of having fresh cutting blades/foils) as other electric razors that I have used over the years.This particular model is built to be waterproof, and functions as advertised, allowing the razor to be used in the shower if wanted. I generally do not shave in the shower but that option is handy and it seems to perform about as well there as it does during dry usage.Other Pros:Rubberized Grip: Blue rubberized grip actually works well in terms of gripping the shaver both in and out of the shower. I actually like the color, but of course opinions will vary.Solid Feel: As part of waterproofing the razor, some of the moving parts seem to have been eliminated, which makes the razor seem more solid and less likely to break.Improved battery: I've used the razor 7-8 times and still haven't seen the charge indicator light up.Cons:No sideburns/beard trimmer: I don't use it often but I do miss this feature. I'm sure Remington has plenty of other options for purchase though.Charging stand: I really don't like having the bulky charging stand as part of the device. I'm sure some will like having the base but I don't like having this accessory, especially if I'm on a long enough trip where I will need the charger. It would be nice to have the option of charging without the base by just plugging the cable directly into the razor.Battery Gauge: While the improved battery life make a difference, the gauge only indicates when the battery is low, versus providing any sort of level/amount of battery remaining.In most ways I think this device is an improvement on the previous model Remington shaver owned. The very basic feature set with improved battery and waterproof housing make it a very basic but useful device to have around in the mornings!";05 20, 2013;ABNMD6670TV53;"R.

;B00BBFQ2MI;[1, 1];5.0;This book is the first in a series that hasn't been completely released yet, so I don't know how the story ends, but the beginning is charmingly enjoyable.Take one young princess, a family wrapped around her finger, add one baby harpy, a special trinket, one big, dangerous secret, and stir. What comes out is sometimes humorous, and sometimes tense but overall is a very good story.There are one or two small points that I think could have been improved-- such as the first page or so spends a little bit too much time reciting the shape and history of the known world and kingdoms in the book, and occasionally in the beginning, the family seems a little too willing to cave to Jenni's wishes, but once you get past that, the story moves along at a decent clip.I also read the author's first novel, London Wild, which was more of a Sci-Fi novel, and I feel his style and writing skills have improved in the Duke's Son. What the author is really good at in both cases, is seeing a big story arc that may have some familiar elements, but manages to go places with the plot that other authors have not been in quite that way.I think this is worth reading if you love medieval fantasy stories.;02 23, 2013;AP40C6G4T7D8N;Brandeline;Fantasy lovers will enjoy the Duke's Son;1361577600

Logitech G400s Optical Gaming Mouse;B00BCEK2LA;[3, 8];3.0;"Having used only Logitech mice for as long as I have been using a computer, there is a similar trend that upheld here with the G400s:With Logitech products you get this type of heirachy:1. The most expensive (70$+) mice are constructed extremely well (body, casing, smoothness of the scroll wheel etc.)---fitting, of course....2. Everything else is of the same quality i.e. cheap plastic feel, loud, grating scroll wheel, loud buttons. No matter the price.Again, this 400s mouse, with its above average price tag (in the middle teir),not getting to the optical quality; this feels like a 20$ mouse.The plastic outer shell, marketed as ""Advance Surface Coatings for Added Comfort and Durability"" feels like...rough plastic without finishing/polishing. Feels rough under your fingertips. Having experience in the past with this type of 'special coating' I can say the sweat from your fingers will produce darkened, warn-in oval shape marks where you click the mouse button after some time.There was a product that Logitech made in the past that used a 'special' plastic coating however I am sure that because that 'technology' was in excess of 7 years ago that it is outdated and un-advanced right? Well this 'coating' was on the Logitech G7 mouse and after using it for more than 7 years, it still has 0 worn in spots, 0 cracks and the top coating---where you hand sits---still looks brand new. This is the sort of mice that I use for my comparisions and the standard of what a mouse of quality should feel like. For those interested the Logitech G7 is here (which is what the 400s and the 400's models are made from):Logitech G7 Laser Cordless Mouse.Here are the grades for the 400s:Construction: 7/10The mouse is lightweight (which is good or bad depending on who is using it) and feels hollow. Obviously any money thrown into this by Logitech was the 'innards'. The outside of the mouse feels solidly put together however it feels like gripping rough plastic.Performance (Optical) 9/10Extremely high precision. *Note this does not have any predictive movement technology out of the box, which may be supported with software* DPI is solid and movement is fluid. Pixel to pixel movement is extremely precise.Buttons:Scroll Wheel 5/10 - The scroll wheel is the clunky type that makes an audible sound when scrolling which creates a slight echo within the mouse body.Click Buttons 7/10 - In the middle of possible decibel levels--not too loud. Does not require a 'long' press to click however, not touch either. A fairly good balanced medium.Sensitivity Buttons 8/10 - These are 'flush' to the surface of the mouse meaning they do not protrude. They make little to no sound when pushed and do not interfere with fast clicking/maneuvering.Side 'Programmable' Side Buttons 7/10 - Very easy to click and lay just above you thumb.

;B00BCFWJ8I;[0, 0];5.0;Opposites attract -- at least when they're both extremely good looking -- so of course rich, urbane, powerful Miles falls for an islander with relatively little money and virtually no experience outside her small town.  But if opposites attract, similarities keep us together, and as they get to know each other better, Miles and Greta find that they're both hard-working, highly responsible, and devoted to their families.  As they take turns showing the other around their home town, sparks fly and they both learn about themselves as well as about the other person. All of which is great fun for the reader, since their story is well constructed, Miles and Greta are very likable characters, their dialogue is snappy, and the settings (idyllic island! Empire State building!) are gorgeous.I enjoyed the first Billionaire Brothers novella and the second was even better.  This last one was best of all, and made me wish there was yet another brother waiting in the wings to find love on Sanctuary Island.;07 20, 2013;A3F88FEKWQCNO1;Professor Chaos;"He was proud and she was prejudiced; also, vice versa.";1374278400

;B00BDS415I;[0, 0];5.0;Great headset. I went into gaming headset research knowing only one brand in Turtle Beach. There were a good number of others that seemed better but were significantly more expensive. For its price, this headset is amazing.Adjustable to fit your head size. It's wired, so there's no need for charging. Wires are long as well so you don't have to sit too close to your screen. There's no hint of feeling uncomfortable even after having it on for a few hours. The ability to set the bass and treble levels as well as having a couple of other useful options really add more value than needed for the price. The only downside for me is that your head/ears area can get hot after wearing it for extended periods.For it's price you get a lot of quality value. If you're looking at this one or a more expensive one and price is a factor in your purchase decision, go with this Turtle Beach headset. You will not be disappointed.;06 16, 2014;A5T2SGA6SUXR7;David Quon;First ever headset. Not disappointed.;1402876800
;B00BDS415I;[4, 6];5.0;"When I saw this turtle beach gaming headset I knew my Xbox loving son would love them, and he does!  He said the headset is ""awesome"" and feels like ""you are in the game"".  The sound quality is amazing and you really feel like you are immersed inside the game which I guess is what any gamer wants.  The inline amp gives the gamer ultimate control with the adjustable bass and treble levels and you can control the game sounds and chat levels you can still engage with your chat.  If you disconnect the amp, you can use the headset in any standard jack so you can use them with tablets, phones, ipads, etc.  I tested them on my Ipad with a movie and the sound was amazing.  Another big plus is that he can wear his glasses comfortably.  Some headsets are so tight that they squeeze the ear and push the glasses stems into your head making it hard if not impossible to wear glasses.  He is able to wear his glasses since the molded ears are much more gentle and he now doesn't have to sit 2 feet from the large screen tv.  Normally a corded headset would be an inconvenience but here the cord is super long so not a problem. No batteries are needed as the headset is USB powered.  All in all, a great headset with features any gamer would love and the versatility to use them with any other audio you may have.

No need to be tethered to the console by a long USB power amplification cord.  Via the PS4 settings menu, you can control the volume and whether you hear only chat or also sound from the game.  I'm also able to use this headset for my Xbox 360 and PS3, so it is incredibly versatile.I bought this when I bought my PS3 and preordered my PS4 after being extremely happy with my Turtle Beach X12 for Xbox 360.

Hayabusa Perfect Stretch Hand Wraps;B00BFDECYQ;[0, 0];5.0;"I purchased the Yellow Ringside wraps (http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B000NZKFMA) for $6.99 with Prime free shipping and the Hayabusa Dark Orchid wraps for $9.99 with free shipping from the seller.I chose these two because they seemed to be the most affordable (including shipping prices) and seemed to have the best reviews. In case this matters: I am a female, 5'5&#34;, and about 155lbs who trains in muay thai at least 3 days a week. I have had these wraps for a week. I will update this if anything noteworthy comes about.Ringside: 4 out 5 StarsPros: sturdy velcro, one side is clearly marked &#34;This Side Down&#34; (although that doesn't really matter to me, a lot of people like that), and overall, pretty comfortable.Cons: I wish the velcro was a little thinner than the width of the wrap, cuz the scratchiness can be annoying.Hayabusa: 5 out of 5Pros: Sturdy Velcro, one side is clearly marked &#34;This Side Up&#34;,  and EXTREMELY comfortable.Cons: The velcro that grips (the scratchy part) usually does not line up as evenly with the  soft part as you may want, due to the elasticity of the wrap. While half of my velcro still connects, I wish  that portion was measured out, better.Overall:They are both much better than my cheap, &#34;free&#34; ones I have. They don't fold or crease as easily as the thinner, cheaper wraps, but I also plan on hand-washing them.The Hayabusa gets 5 out of 5 simply due to the comfort level. I put on the Ringside and trained with them, first, and thought, &#34;These are pretty good.&#34; I put on the Hayabusa and thought, &#34;Oh my God, these are the most comfortable things I have ever worn (on my hands)!&#34; Definitely worth the extra $3!";02 1, 2014;A2NXLFCKYQMLTY;V.

Jabra REVO Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headphones - Retail Packaging - Black;B00BFO14W8;[2, 2];5.0;I really like this headphone. I know, I know.... it's too much money, but I already tried almost all the cheap headset that are under $200 but they are all useless and just a waste of money.My business requires me to be on the phone almost all the time, talking, negotiating, advising, getting and giving quotes. So clear connection is everything. Loved the design of this too. You have the option to use the wired option if you need more reliable and clearer connection. Edgy color and design w/c I really like - fire orange, you will either love it or hate it. I love it! foldable as well. highly recommended if it fits your budget.Oh, wait! it comes with really cheap draw string case - so don't say I didn't warn you.I did not take off a star because I am more focused on the sound quality and connection.;08 7, 2013;A1O0KGJF1EGLAD;"Agent Sam | Austin, TX USA ""Agent Sam | Austi...";Great sound, sturdy material - edgy design!;1375833600
Jabra REVO Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headphones - Retail Packaging - Black;B00BFO14W8;[1, 2];5.0;The sound quality is superb.  Unlike my prior Bluetooth headphones that lost reception when I would turn or wave my arm inbetween my phone and headphones, these surprisingly do not!  I read a review on here of someone saying they did, so I purchased a Bluetooth transmitter just incase.  But it's not needed, thankfully.UPDATE: Mysteriously the REVO headphones started randomly breaking the connection to the iPhone 5, as another user described.  So if your going to buy these you should probably consider getting a Bluetooth transmitter as well.Call quality - perfect.  No complaints from either side.One tricky thing is the controls on the headphones.  Perhaps I'll get the hang of them with some use.  The buttons are not well defined, in fact only one is defined, you just have to take a good guess where to tap.  if you slide your finger around you may end up turning the volume up or down.Excellent headphones overall however.;09 5, 2013;A2K03Z5NTBQZVL;Daniel William Evans;These are by far the best headphones I've ever owned or even used;1378339200

Jabra REVO Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headphones - Retail Packaging - Black;B00BFO14W8;[1, 1];4.0;Wireless: Excellent on bluetooth. Clear, doesn't get staticky (that a word?) for me, range is better than i'm accustomed to on my old headphones and works throughout my home. Surprise feature: connects to multiple devices (and remembers this) and will switch to receive alert sounds - somewhat disconcerting when not expecting it, but I think it's a nice feature. Note: only receives audio from one at a time, so one device can interrupt another.Software: Be nice if it worked from the computer maybe? I was able to put software on multiple iOS devices i own with the same code. If there is a computer version, i'm not aware of it, i use the features of my audio on the computer to refine audio if i need to. I don't use the song feature on the iPad i synced it to, i'd rather just use iTunes. So can't comment on this feature.Battery: excellent duration - have yet to 'run out' of battery during use (i go 2-5 hours at a time).Construction: excellent. I don't travel with them, so the folding capability isn't something i take advantage of.Packaging: it's such that you don't want to dispose of the packaging. For those who like packaging i guess.Comfort: Hurts after a short amount of time. Initially i thought it was OK. But it simply puts too much pressure on my ears with the small cup size. I have a fairly small head - i don't pull the bands out at all to extend the cups - but after a time the pressure is such that my ears hurt. My current solution - put the headphones over a box cover stretching out the band and leaving it there over night. The next day, it doesn't press so much on my ears for a while. I have to do this every few days at the moment.Controls: i like the volume and controls for advancing songs, etc. Nice touch (pun intended). Only issue for me is that the headphones have their own volume from the output of the computer then, so hard to know where it is set for reference.Mic(s): i haven't honestly played with this much. I'm disconcerted that when i switch to mic, the audio on my computer switches from stereo to mono. That, honestly, sucks for game play (using Vent with MMORPG for example). I haven't tested it much except to notice it does that, which means the game audio sucks in mono. At least my brief testing indicated this, i'm not 100% sure if this is a computer issue or headphone/bluetooth issue because i seem to recall my previous headphone set did this too.Cables: excellent except for plugging into headphone issue: plug on headphones impossible to see and since it must go in a particular way makes it even harder - which i don't like, i have trouble plugging them in each time. I just use the charging cable. Other one still in the package.Color: wish the white had been available for wireless, but otherwise nice.disclaimer: my unprofessional 2 cents worth based on my use. Overall i put 4 stars, but some are 3 stars and some 5 stars based on the above. What i really like about these is the audio quality (i'm not a professional audio person or anything) is wonderful for me and the battery life is fantastic. Comfort is the one thing that i'm really unhappy about with these. I'm assuming it's because of the cup size pressing on my ears with constant but slight pressure for some reason.;04 14, 2013;A2TP5SRFNF4DO5;"John I.

Jabra REVO Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headphones - Retail Packaging - Black;B00BFO14W8;[1, 1];5.0;I have to say I was a bit skeptical about these headphones because I bought the Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Black/Yellow years ago. I was unimpressed by those headphones and bought a pair if Jaybird Freedoms which I love. Anyway, back to Jabra REVO Wireless, these are phenomenal headphones out of the box.  With beautiful highs and warm but controlled lows. The Bass is not exaggerated like on the beats headphones. The bass is just the perfect balance. I am listening to Pat Martino's Undeniable and they capture the performance in a way as if you are their. I would also say they are 10 times better than the Parrot Zik Headphones in terms of sound, reception and ease of use. I had the Parrots for about 2 months before they were stollen. My complaints with the Parrot Ziks are that I often had problems with the signal skipping inside and outside. Also, I was not a fan of the fact that in order to adjust the sound you had to use an app. The Jabra do come with an app that you can download for both android and Apple iOS devices. However, I have not found a need to install it.  Lastly, I would also easily put these up against the Harman Kardon BT's. I recommend that headset, but Jabra's top that set in terms of clarity and intuitive controls. Parrot at least had a good idea when they in cooperated the gesturing method of control on their headphones. However, Parrot needs to work on the quality of those headphones controls. I had glitches in the controls.Finally, I think the Jabra's are lighter and are able to passively block noise better than the ZIKs. I would also say they are overall better than  SOL  Repbulic tracks headphones (just the tracks, not the HDs or ultra tracks);06 7, 2013;A3OP28REKSGCFG;Will;Best bluetooth headset by far;1370563200

;B00BI1CWOC;[1, 2];4.0;"Mandy's Review:Reincarnation: The ability to live your life over and over again in different times and bodies until you get ""it"" right. What the ""it"" is depends on each person and their life. Many people believe in reincarnation as part of their spiritual beliefs or religion. If that's something you believe in, well, I don't really agree with you but I respect your beliefs. It is an interesting idea to think we have multiple opportunities to live our lives until we finally succeed at whatever it is our mission (for lack of a better term) is. The Knightmare is based upon this premise.Conor's nightmares are actually memories that he's forgotten. Often times he remembers nothing upon waking, other than he has a fear of bodies of water. When he meets Mercedes, he feels an instant connection with her. Is it because she's so personable? So friendly? So willing to help him overcome his nightmares and fears? Or is she someone from his past lives that he has known? They only spend one night together in the present day, but it is enough for them both to be sure they are destined to be together ... too bad her death mucks things up. Despite the connection, Conor is shocked when he realizes Mercedes has left everything to him in her will.As Conor tries to help the police solves Mercedes strange death, he takes a trip back into time ... literally ... through his dreams. He experiences the first time he and Mercedes ever met and came to know one another. How many times will they have to live their lives until they're finally able to be together fully?The Knightmare is definitely an intriguing take on reincarnation and time travel. It had a slightly slow start, but not enough of one to make me stop reading this book. Once it got going, I kept turning the pages to see what would happen next. While it's not one of my absolutely favorite books, it does rank high enough that I will probably read it again in the future.*An ecopy of this book was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.";05 17, 2013;A2LPM9CYPRD5PO;"Literary R&amp;R";Will Probably Read Again;1368748800

Panasonic SCHTB70 2.1-Channel Soundbar with Built-In Subwoofer;B00BI4JX2I;[4, 6];4.0;This Panasonic 2.1 channel soundbar is a quality home theater sound option. It has a built-in subwoofer and multiple settings for how it projects sound, both in terms of how you place and angle the speaker and in how the speaker generates sound. There is actually a sensor for the angle which lights up a different color depending on the angle it's positioned at. For movies and dramas the 3D sound simulation setting is a nice effect, though not as good as a full 3D effect of a multispeaker home theater.This speaker is designed to be used with a TV in approximately the 40-60 inch range - it has both a digital audio connection input and the left/right RCA type audio connection input (you can connect a stereo or DVD/Blu-Ray player to it) and it offers wireless reception of Bluetooth audio signals when you place the bluetooth device close to the speaker. It uses the 2.4 ghz frequency band so there can be interference with other wireless devices such as routers. It is also recommended to keep it in a ventilated space, not enclosed in a cabinet. There are accessories to mount it on a table or a wall, a remote control (that uses a lithium button battery) and an IR blaster to use in case there's an issue with it interfering with your TV remote's IR signal. Coordinating the sound control with a TV is something you'll have to test out - you may have to turn the volume down on your TV if using the soundbar doesn't disable the TV speakers, though I didn't encounter that issue myself.I found this easy to set up, though if you run into any problem be sure to read the manual/instructions. The sound quality is a big improvement over the built-in sound in most flat screen TVs, and the soundbar is a good option if you don't want a more extensive home theater setup. One thing that I felt could have been included was a digital audio cable to connect to a TV since this is marketed as being for use with TVs. This unit uses a bit of energy even when turned off, so it is suggested to unplug it when not in use. Panasonic puts in a disclaimer that there can be issues with Bluetooth and that the security of a Bluetooth connection can't be guaranteed.I like this speaker, though I would encourage anyone who gets it to fully read the manual when setting it up... there's more to this than some other types of speaker systems and you may have to troubleshoot some issues, especially with Bluetooth signals and IR remote signals.;05 30, 2013;A2L4ZGN7GZJ95T;Jed Shlackman;Versatile soundbar ideal for large TV, read instructions;1369872000

Sun Joe MJ403E Mow Joe 13-Amp Corded Electric Lawn Mower, 17-Inch;B00BIX12CI;[1, 2];4.0;"This is the first electric lawn mower I have ever tried.  One of my neighbors uses an electric lawn mower to mow her lawn, but this is not one for everybody.  This is ideal for someone with a very small lawn.  The advantage of this mower over a gas powered one is that it is very light and you never need to worry about keeping gas on hand to mow the lawn.  The mower seems just a bit louder than a vacuum cleaner when it is cutting the grass (in other words it is very quiet).The set up of the mower was common sense and didn&#8217;t take long at all.  Do not let the plastic construction fool you &#8211; this mower has some power!  I accidentally ran over the kid&#8217;s plastic pail and it destroyed instantly.  I didn&#8217;t think I would run over it and thought it would get pushed to the side when I got near it &#8211; but it got sucked right up and was ruined.The disadvantage is that if you have a large lawn, it will get tiring walking around with the extension cord.  I really don&#8217;t trust myself in using this mower, as I am afraid I will run over the cord.  So this is really only ideal for mowing a small patch of grass if one is diligent enough to keep the cord away and not run over it.";07 1, 2014;A2ULQOGN59LDNK;Richard J.

Goody's Headache Relief Shots, Citrus, 2 Fluid Ounce;B00BLPFYFY;[7, 9];2.0;"With a 20+ year of daily chronic headache, I have come to depend on Goody's Powders as my only source of pain relief.  Doctors have been unable to determine the source of my headache and have prescribed many, many different medications in an attempt to alleviate, or at least control, the pain. I have also tried over-the-counter medications such as Tylenol, with no success; I always go back to Goody's powders. Recently, my husband noticed the Goody's Headache Shots and thought it would be worthwhile for me to try them on those really bad days.  Unfortunately, even though the label bore the ""Goody's name"", the shot does not contain the same ingredients as the powders (powders have 260mg acetaminophen (Tylenol), 520mg aspirin and 32.5mg caffeine while the shot has 1000mg acetaminophen and 65mg caffeine, but NO aspirin).  I tried the shot, but got NO relief.  I was extremely disappointed in the results, but more importantly in the fact that one of the main ingredients that makes Goody's ""Goody's"" was missing.  If extra strength Tylenol works for you, take Tylenol.  If Goody's powders work for you, take them.  I would not recommend that you spend the extra money to buy the headache shots.";07 11, 2013;A1FDEPY7QWE8TZ;Peggy;Disappointed in Goody's Headache Shots;1373500800
All Balls Steering Stem Bearing Kit 22-1064;B00BLPOR8O;[0, 0];4.0;For the most part, I like ordering with Powersport Superstore.  What you have to watch thought if you do not pay for shipping is they will wait on some orders till the LAST possible day to ship, some things come pretty quick, but with these I had to wait nearly 2 weeks, with my bike sitting in parts in the garage it was pretty agonizing. It is hard to find better prices, and if you order enough shipping is free, but if you need something smaller and in a hurry, you may be better off shopping elsewhere for a few dollars more, because Powersports shipping rates are jacked up to RIDICULOUS numbers.  I just don't understand, it takes just as much effort to walk down an aisle, pick up a part, print a label and ship on Monday rather than Thursday, just to make people happy and to receive higher reviews and more return customers, because in the age of Amazon, no one wants to pay for shipping or wait for more than 2 to 3 days for an item.  In addition, you are not going to get what is in the picture.  No seals of any kind, just the exact same stuff you would get 40 years ago, a couple of races with individual ball bearings that you have to grease in place, not even any cages to hold the balls.

I originally got a Pbone in blue, but I was attracted to the more natural brass look of the Tromba.  It plays fine, and just as good as the Pbone, but within days the finish started peeling off.  I now have several small spots on the instrument that are black because the finish is gone.  By the way, these plastic trombones sound just like the brass ones, and are a great buy for beginners, or someone who has just wanted to own a trombone.

Sony HVLLEIR1LED Battery Video and IR Light (Black);B00BMTTO0U;[0, 1];5.0;I purchased this light to replace a Sony HVL-10NH that developed some internal circuitry problems.  I became interested in this model because it features LED technology that didn't exist when I bought the light that failed and I thought the price was reasonable.  So far, I couldn't be happier with my choice.  From a cursory look, it appears to put out as much light as the HVL-10NH, but runs much cooler.  I haven't used it enough to make any statements on battery life, but I would expect it to be quite good compared to a halogen bulb.  Some people may not be entirely pleased with the bluish-white light that these types of LEDs produce, but I've found the color balance pleasing and if you want a color temperature that is more towards what an incandescent type of bulb might produce, there is a built in filter that flips out and down to accomplish that.  The unit is not terribly large but it might appear to be overly large and bulky to some given the small size of many of today's camcorders.I'm using this with a Sony HDR-CX290 camcorder.  Be aware that this unit was not designed to be used with that device compared to other Sony cameras and camcorders.  In fact, in my case, I may have paid for some technology that I can't use, such as the IR feature and there is no shoe on my camcorder to mount this light.  Make sure you understand that if you purchase this for use on a device not specifically designed to use it.  Sony even makes that suggestion on the box.  If you use this on a camcorder that does not have a shoe to mount it, you will need some type of bracket to hold it.  I have been using a Stroboframe flip bracket that I already owned.  Some may find that a bit too large and awkward.  I'm sure there are other options.  If you use this on a camera or camcorder not designed for it, you probably will need to be a bit creative.  But I'm sure you will be pleased with the results and find it was worth the effort.I was pleased with the vendor that sold this through Amazon.

;B00BND1UTS;[0, 0];5.0;I am a fan of Kallysten, from my first introduction to her slightly different than ordinary vampires, and a writing style that just feels like a friend is telling a story.  This novella is no different, and introduces us to a new cast of characters that are as enjoyable as they are frustrating.Angelina is a personal assistant to Delilah, a wealthy patroness of the arts.  From organizing galas to accomplishing some seriously outrageous tasks her job seems pretty cushy.  And Angelina weaves an interesting tale, part fact, part reminiscence and part mystery, we travel with her to a very exclusive party for Morgan Ward, to celebrate his birthday.  All that Angelina knows is that her boss, Delilah's brother, and that she was specifically warned to be polite.When we are finally told that Angelina has been compelled, and she cannot leave Ward's mansion, the story gets more interesting as she fights the realization that vampires exist, and yet she isn't afraid of Morgan.Lushy detailed while maintaining some revelations for further installments, this story is both beautifully written and classically Kallysten.  Emotional turmoil and clever conversation and banter display the personalities of both main characters, as the story and their connection is tentatively established.  Add to that some unique abilities and explanations for compulsion, and the wait for Delilah's return to undo the compulsion begins.  With nothing to do but get to know one another.Sexy interactions that vary between fantasy and reality add to the tension in the story and further build the characters as people you want to know. And you will after this introduction to the Ward of the Vampire series.I purchased a copy of this book for my personal library.

New 2013 Clinique Even Better Compact Makeup Spf 15 ~ IVORY;B00BNQALVI;[0, 0];4.0;"I had been looking for a stick foundation ever since my supply was depleted of Prescriptives Perfect Matchsticks, which I ordered in bulk when I found out they were being discontinued.  I tried a number of sticks, but could find none that had the texture I wanted or the shade I needed (too many were yellow or orange based, which I can't wear with my ""cool"" skin tone).  I then tried a cream foundation by Prescriptives but they discontinued that too and it did not provide the degree of coverage that the Perfect Matchsticks did (please bring them back!).  I tried Max Factor sticks that many people praised but found they were too heavy and unnatural looking, showed every pore in my face and I could not find an appropriate shade.  I then tried Merle Norman, which worked for several months before irritating my skin.  Finally, I walked into blue mercury in Hingham, MA one day and they recommended this Clinique cream foundation.  They found a good color match and I decided to try it.  It's been great!  It covers very well.  It does not clog my pores.  It is not greasy but, in fact, feels soft and powdery after application.  Who knew I would return to a foundation by Clinique (I wear Clinique blush and eye pencil but haven't worn their foundations since my 20s -- and I'm in my 50s now).  My skin is sensitive, underlying pink tones, and I tend to wear colors in the plum/violet family.  I was surprised that the ivory foundation was the best match for me because I tend to think of ivory as a ""warm"" tone.  It seems to be more of an alabaster or bisque shade.

Klipsch RF-82II BLACK 5.1 System-Harman Kardon AVR 3700, BIC Acoustech PL-200 x 2 EACH!;B00BPDHHSY;[3, 3];5.0;"This package deal is absolutely incredible.  I was going to buy all the same speakers with the exception of the PL-200 subs, and was looking at getting a Denon receiver that did 7.2 surround as well.  Just for the Klipsch reference speakers in this package, it would cost you over $3800.  So you are getting the rear surrounds, the receiver, and the two subwoofers basically for free.  And you get a full warranty as the seller is an authorized reseller of the equipment and well known in the industry.  I got my system all setup at home and paired it with an Epson 5020UB 3D projector and a 100&#34; Elite DH2 3D screen and it is fantastic!  I love everything about this package with the exception of the HarmonKardon receiver.  The HK 3700 receiver is very nice, but the menu systems are clunky, and the support department was terrible.  I was having my video cut out on my during movies, and gave them a call to find out why.  They said they don't support any HDMI cables over 15 feet at all for TVs or projectors.  I told them that cables are used up to 50 feet all the time for these purposes, but they said it won't work on their system.  So they left me hanging and I had to come up with my own solution.  The speakers are amazing, the subs will blow you out of the water with amazing bass.

3P 3 Phase 30A 3.7KW Self Lock On/Off Power Pushbutton Switch TBSP-330;B00BQK7SKI;[0, 0];1.0;The diagram accurately reflects the actual product. However, it is a poor quality product. The size of the switch is accurate - I measured it to be 4.6cm W x 9.1 cm H x 5.1 cm D.Positive: It is a 3-phase switch in that it can switch all three phases as shown in the diagram. The contacts appear to be well made. The switch is latching - pressing the ON switch causes it to be latched down, pressing the OFF switch causes the ON switch to pop out.Negative: The switch has two rubber plugs (one on each end) with no strain relief. There is no room to add a strain relief since there barely is enough space for the wires. When I'm switching up to 30 A, I need a strain relief to ensure the wires don't get pulled out. The rubber plugs are very thin - they provide no support and can easily be pulled out.The latching mechanism for the switch is made of plastic. When the ON switch is pushed in, a plastic tab on the OFF switch hold the ON switch down. This piece of plastic will wear out very quickly.There are no UL or other safety markings on the switch.You are much better off paying a little more for a better switch. For me, this switch is going in the spare parts bin and I'm buying a different switch.;05 1, 2014;AOIARHI764ML4;W. Chilson;Low Quality Product;1398902400

Here is the recommended order of things to do to get it working more quickly than I did:1) Setup the wifi link using a temporary USB cord to your wireless computer. My attempt to connect directly from the LCD of the printer did not work.2) When the wifi link is set, put the ISP address for the printer (it's a small web server) into your web browser and register your computer with Google Cloud Print (full directions are at the Brother website).3) If the printer shows up as &#34;offline&#34; check the installed firmware (directions are on the Brother website). Even though we received this computer in late December, the firmware had not been updated (despite several updates throughout 2013), and Google thought the printer was offline until the firmware was upgraded.4) When the firmware was upgraded, Cloud Print worked great.In short, a little Googling about the steps above will save you a lot of time!";01 2, 2014;AJUUXVNCCECHL;Philalethes;Tips for getting started...;1388620800

;B00BR8KHUW;[2, 2];3.0;Jake is just an ordinary boy who wants to be liked.This sentence sums up Jake pretty well.  The story of Jake is the story of a pretty ordinary teenage boy going through his ordinary day to day life.  I think that is what makes this book interesting, the fact that Jake is just like the kid next door...or just like you.  He has a good home, a nice life, and satisfying friendships.  He is not some secret superpower waiting to be discovered - he's just Jake.The characters are well written and believable.  Jake's little brother Ben is cute.  I think it is hard to write kids and make them credible, but the author is able to do it here.Overall I enjoyed this story, though it was a bit depressing.  I guess life is sometimes, though.

;B00BRGL3U2;[7, 8];5.0;"Credo with Helene Grimaud on piano is just out on BD Audio [only]. Absolutely wonderful. The SACD version of the same performance earns all 5-star ratings. The &#34;video&#34; on screen menu says 192 kHz/24 bit, but the box indicia indicate 96 kHz/24 bit for all three codecs, LPCM, DTS HD Master and Dolby TrueHD audio. Likewise, my OPPO BDP-105 also reads the audio as 96/24. If anything, I would think BD-A is potentially superior to the SACD as a high quality digital format, although I have not heard the SACD version of Credo myself. I do have more than a few SACDs, and my BD-A collection is also growing.The performances include works by Corigliano, Beethoven and Part, just as for the SACD and CD. For the CD, one person gave a one star user review for clipping distortion. Whatever issue might have existed on CD in that person's setup, the BD is pristine as to any technical fault in my setup; it sounds absolutely fabulous. It remain a stereo performance, not remastered to 5.1 as many older movies have been for BD. As to lacking 5.1, I would argue why mess with what is pretty much perfection? And, the BD-A is currently much lower in price than the same thing on SACD, so it's a great bargain to boot.

;B00BS3AE7W;[2, 2];5.0;It's difficult to write a review that contains no spoilers, and even more difficult to try to describe how beautifully this story was written.The two MCs, Paddy and Jac, are brought together when Paddy is given Jac as a patient.  Paddy is a Level One Impath and was told he needed to evaluate and see if there was anything worth saving in Jac.  Jac had been physically injured.  He made no sense when he spoke and no one thought he would recover. Paddy learns why no one was able to understand Jac and from there, they learned how to communicate with each other.There is a sweetness to Paddy that I dare anyone not to fall for.  He is the kind of person you want to cuddle up to.  His personality is generous and more than special.Paddy is trying to figure out why he is so drawn to Jac and what was so great about Freedom.There are very few books I give five stars to, especially ones that aren't dark, emotional erotica.

We no longer recieved gems and could no longer spend them. Also, when they added a new town/spawn, they made it cool, and kindle users got it right away, but while adding that they made it to where every minute or two Avabel stops responding.

Spiegelau 2-Pack Beer Classics IPA Glass, 19-Ounce;B00BTPUT3S;[0, 0];4.0;I got these for Xmas and really like them.  The glass holds about 16 -17 ounces of beer and really delivers on letting you enjoy the smell of the beer when drinking.  A really well hopped IPA especially one that was dry or fresh hopped is better with this glass.  My only concern is the fact that the glass is very thin.  It makes the glass light and easy to drink from but it might be a lot easier to break as well.  Overall I am very satisfied and would buy again.;01 18, 2014;A2LZXFGZOMFS98;DJK;Nice glasses and Great for IPA;1390003200
Spiegelau 2-Pack Beer Classics IPA Glass, 19-Ounce;B00BTPUT3S;[0, 0];5.0;These IPA glasses are quite thin, and seem a bit overpriced, but I've loved drinking out of them so I'm still giving them 5 stars. I like hoppy, fresh IPAs with lots of smell, and these glasses do my favorite style of beer justice. I like being able to pour as vigorously as I want without worrying about head overflow. These are a pleasure to drink out of, I particularly like when the beer is almost gone and it creates a little waterfall from the handle into the upper portion of the glass as you tip it. I don't keep these in my cabinet, but put them on a separate shelf to reduce breaking them. I also don't put these in the dishwasher, but just carefully hand-wash them.;12 9, 2013;A3BKK86IOLQD7A;Jonny;Enjoyable IPA glasses, a bit thin.;1386547200
Spiegelau 2-Pack Beer Classics IPA Glass, 19-Ounce;B00BTPUT3S;[31, 32];5.0;After reading some of the reviews of these glasses regarding their quality (or at least the thinness and breakability of the glass), I was a little hesitant.  I was also a little skeptical about whether they could deliver a different experience with IPA.After receiving the glasses and using them for a couple of weeks with several different IPA types, I can say yes, they do deliver, and no, they're not low quality.  The glass is thin, but fairly strong as far as I can tell.  They're thin for a reason.  The beer stays much cooler for much longer in a glass with a thin bowl.  It's very noticeable.Regarding the flavor experience, the difference is striking when comparing the same IPA in this and different glass types.  There's much more noticeable aroma from the hops and other elements such as citrus, especially when you get about halfway into the pour.  I think bars serving craft beer would do well to pick some of these up to enhance their IPA loving customers' experience.  For me, it's become much more enjoyable to enjoy a good IPA at home out of my new glasses than to sit in a beer or tap room, sipping IPA out of a pint glass.The glasses are easy to wash by hand, but are apparently dishwasher safe.  I just put a little soap and water in them and swirl it before allowing to air dry.  I wouldn't recommend trying to shove your hand in them because I'm guessing they will break.  I'm guessing there will be imitators using thicker glass, but that would defeat the purpose, right?  Thin is good.Moral of the story?  If you love IPA, pull the trigger.  Twenty bucks for two is a solid buy.;08 16, 2013;AS68NCG465SP5;Matt A.;Very happy w/ my purchase;1376611200

Other reviews praise these glasses for accentuating the taste/flavor of beer.  I don't believe these claims can stand up to a blind taste test (i.e., same beer with different glasses); actually, it would be difficult to do this test blind unless someone else were holding the glass.  Anyway, what these glasses definitely do is create a greater head for the beer, and this can help with enjoying the beer's aroma.  If you are expecting a world of difference, prepare to be underwhelmed.  This glass can, however, make a small difference in your beer tasting experience.";12 2, 2013;A2B9LVND9PB7NZ;Tung T Nguyen;Interesting, but do not expect a world of difference;1385942400

Tuscan Sconces - Set of 2;B00BUD7BTY;[0, 0];5.0;Exactly as pictured. I like these sconces because they aren't too ornate, just a few curls and loops without being too fussy. The only issue I encountered was that a votive size candle would not fit in one of the sconces. It fit in the black metal holder, but the opening in the hurricane glass was too small at the bottom to allow it to go over the candle. However, I substituted taper candles (using a bit of putty on their bottoms so they would stay standing) and they look great. I'm sure I could have returned the sconces, but the taper candles work fine and it would have been too much of a hassle to send the sconces back. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.;03 3, 2014;A1QE4V3SKU7R4M;Maryland Shopper;Beautiful Sconces;1393804800

China Glaze Nail Polish Lacquer 81280 Unrefined 0.5floz 14ml;B00BUR65S8;[0, 0];3.0;"So I am really into textured polish right now. I had tried pretty much every brand out there. I saw these and fell in love with the bright neon colors and had to give it a go. Compared to OPI and Zoya this polish is very runny/thin. I find it harder to apply evenly than either of those brands. To get a fully opaque nail I have to put this on thick and use at least two coats. I put on one coat, let it dry for about 15 minutes and it seemed fairly dry.  So then put on a second a coat, and let it dry for another 15 minutes. Even after all that time the polish was still tacky and felt very rubbery and plastic. If I pushed it on with the tip of my finger or fingernail it would push up and be ruined. This was so disappointing. After waiting much longer (about another 25 to 30 minutes) it finally seemed to harden up. However, I don't have an hour every day to wait for polish to dry so I don't how much I will use this. On the plus side, the neon color and texture are gorgeous. It is a bright pure bubblegum pink shade with plenty of ""sand"". I like that this polish is just pure opaque color without any glitter (all the OPI sand and Zoya pixie dusts are glitter filled) so this was a nice change. So basically if you can get it applied evenly and get it to dry it looks amazing. But boy is it a process to get to that point. I am not sure if it is just this particular color or all the China Glaze textures that have this issue. I am going to try applying again in thinner coats and see if that helps the problem with dry time at all.";06 5, 2013;A34GQ3JF4BGFYV;shopaholic mom;Love the color and texture, hate the formulation;1370390400

;B00BURWSLG;[1, 1];4.0;"I have all the Poodles cd's and was anxiously awaiting the new release. My opinion is that each of the other cd's have multiple standout songs on them and also songs that are forgettable and that I skip when they come on. This new cd to me only has one outstanding track and that is the bonus track done in their native language ""En for Alla for En"", which to me is easily in their top 5 songs ever. The interesting thing though is that while none of the other songs stand out to me, I like them all and listen to every track when it plays. It is unreasonable to expect every new song/cd from a band to be better than everything they've done prior, and for me Performocracy is still their best. Having said that, if you are a fan of their music you will like this cd and will enjoy listening to it for a long time.";06 6, 2013;A5RKDVXUOC2A9;G. Cox;A maturing band;1370476800
;B00BURWSLG;[3, 4];5.0;I wasn't a fan of The Poodles earlier works. To me all the albums before Performocracy (the band's previous album) were too much pop for me and not enough rock. Once I listened to Performocracy though, I was hooked by the band, especially the guitar work and the vocals.Tour De Force is a satisfying album for fans of Performocracy and delivers the emotional melodic rock fans have come to expect.

The expansion pack downloaded with no probs. Sure, I was irritated that I had to go through origin.

;B00C061HZY;[2, 2];5.0;"This is freaky. Just before writing this review, I put on Steely Dan's LP Pretzel Logic. Right before the first number, &#34;Rikki Don't Lose that Number&#34;, there's a bloopy sounding electronic riff. It sounds identical to a, well, bloopy riff, that precedes a cut on the album on review here. To say that, therefore, Random Access Memories is derivative, is to say that the Beatle's Sgt. Pepper is derivative of the first 50 years of music in the 20th Century. Pepper is an homage, a sum-up (and a send-up), an appreciation. RAM surveys dance music from its ancient beginnings in the '70's to, I suppose, the present. How it differs from Sgt. Pepper is that it is a heartfelt tribute; ironically, this disc, produced &#34;by robots&#34;, is the most human album I've heard in ages. I was never a fan of electronica, but RAM has really gotten under my skin. I found myself dancing with headphones on at 2am (as golden slumbers filled my wife's head). I heard of the album through an audiophile magazine (you know, high priced stereo equipment) review, and audiophiles don't ordinarily cotton to dance music, a testament to the, I think, universal appeal of this Daft Punk effort. I've listened to their earlier stuff, and as good as it is it sounds like mere backing tracks to the RAM cuts. Random Access Memories is a rich, moving (your emotions and your booty) effort. I'm writing this shortly before Xmas 2013, and I'm hoping this album wins Best of 2013 and, hence, gains as wide an audience as possible.";12 18, 2013;A1QQPVZ1GTAZAT;"Tin Tan ""TNT""";The Sgt.

Of course my Vizio Smart TV (also a bargain, $448 for a 42"" TV) already handles things like movie downloads directly from my Mac wirelessly (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.), but it's nice to be able to show slideshows or videos directly from the laptop.At under $10 this seems like quite a bargain and it's utterly simple which is probably its best feature.

Today my phone got knocked out of my hands and fell on the floor, I had believed that my phone would be fine due to the fact it had a hard case with a cover over it that served as sort of a bumper. Well it turns out I was COMPLETELY wrong about my phone being fine. When I looked at it and pressed the lock button my screen wouldn't light up, I then took out the battery hoping maybe hard-booting it would help. Nope! It took about 10-15 minutes for my screen to finally light up, and when it did there was a yellow band at the bottom and a crack in the right corner. Latter on, about 40 minutes, I realized something else wrong with my screen. About 80% was tinted purple, and the tint continues to grow, covering more of the screen and becoming darker. I now cannot see certain parts of my screen and if any words/numbers are remotely light in color its impossible to read.

;B00C5XV0PY;[1, 1];5.0;"Billy was a 10 year old boy in 1975, having a blast with his friends in the snow, building forts, throwing snowballs, terrorizing each other as kids do. But a little fun turned into a horror that has stayed with Billy into adulthood, bringing nightmares every time the news reports a snow day.Snow Day by Dan Maurer is a novella, so it's a short read. It also flows so well that you may find yourself reading it in just one or two sittings. It's a tale of innocence lost. And it's presented in an intriguing format that reveals the story in pieces, making it a suspenseful thriller.As someone who group up in the &#8216;70s, this story really hit close to home for me. I remember when I was 6 years old, a girl in my town was abducted and later found dead. It was shocking for everyone. But even after that incident, my friends and I had so much freedom in our neighborhood. We played in the woods, far away from any houses, often. Today, I can&#8217;t imagine giving my children that much freedom. It&#8217;s too scary. But I guess the question really is: Is it more dangerous for kids now or are we just more worried about it and aware of it than our parents were? It&#8217;s an interesting question to think about, and it was the inspiration behind Snow Day.If you're looking for a short thriller that will bring you back to a time of innocence, definitely check out Snow Day.";11 17, 2013;A1F8LTOZGS8E9V;Book-Loving Mom of Two;A tale of innocence lost;1384646400

;B00C7BZYRO;[0, 0];4.0;"[This review is for those who've seen the film already, so proceed with caution]What a surprise -- a movie about real teenagers.Not sure if it works as well without the talented young lead actors, Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley.  Of course, &#34;Divergent&#34; has apparently made both of them stars, especially Ms. Woodley.  I've not seen that film, but I doubt their work there is better than what they do here, which, in certain moments like before they make love for the first time, is painfully real.  Brings back so many memories for this aging bad boy who had his fair share of romances with nice girls.  The writers and director -- all male, basing their work on a novel by a male writer -- decided to go for total honesty, dredging up memories of their assorted first loves.  The realism thus engendered in the dialogue helps the young actors along, who speak their lines as if they're the first things out of their mouths rather than words from a script.  All in all, the movie captures the intense joy and pain of adolescent romance without resorting to overhyped dramatic situations.Teller plays Sutter, a popular high school senior who is, in a rather unlikely manner, generous in his popularity, open to all friendships, including ones with hot girls, lanky nerds, and ponytailed ingenues like Woodley.  He doesn't even resent the young man who steals his first girlfriend -- in fact, Teller gives the guy some sound love-life advice, because, you know, bros.  As I said, the performances, rather than the characters per se, make this believable.  While Teller's character is clearly a novelist's construct, Woodley's &#34;Aimee&#34; surprisingly comes across as the more genuine character.  She is just emerging from the chrysalis of childhood, trembling around all over the place like a newborn colt, and, quite inevitably, falling hard for the first guy who speaks to her in a friendly way.  The fascination with the &#34;awesome&#34; manga super-heroines and such falls by the wayside as soon as Teller introduces her to his flask and gives her her first kiss.  Before long, she drapes herself around her beau like ivy, making plans for the future that include shacking up in Philadelphia while she matriculates.  (&#34;Sounds great,&#34; Teller says uncertainly.)  Woodley delivers a touching performance; I'm predicting major stardom that will go beyond the current cinematic adaptation of the latest YA dystopian fiction.But this is Teller's show.  He conveys to perfection an easy-going youth on the surface who is meanwhile seething with self-doubt, resentment over a missing father, and an underlying sense of doom.  He bops around the high school campus and his job selling menswear carrying a flask in his pocket and his convenience-store cups of spiked soda always in-hand, and we can't help but worry about him. (It helps that Teller seems like such a likable kid.)  Certain young people start anesthetizing themselves from the pain of life with a constant supply of booze even before they've lived long enough to become proper alcoholics, and other young people take it upon themselves to try to save these budding alcoholics by offering the steadiness and responsibility of a sexual relationship.  (It's usually the females who try to do the saving, but sometimes it's the other way around.)  And, as in all codependent relationships, each partner is getting something from the other: in his case, a nonjudgmental lover who adores him, and in her case, some &#34;boyfriend experience&#34; to be stored up for more mature encounters later in life.  And indeed -- remember, I warned about spoilers -- the last shot of the film shows us a young woman who has moved quite beyond Teller after just a few short months of separation, regardless of whether or not Teller has matured or quit drinking.  The guarded smile by Woodley is masterful.  I wonder if this ending is actually preferable to the book's ending, which apparently has Sutter drunk in a bar congratulating himself on setting his girlfriend free because he wasn't good enough for her.  The screenwriters set up a happy ending as a possible alternative, only to make it even more complicated and, in my view, far better than what novelist Tim Tharp came up with.4 stars out of 5.  The fifth star is withheld because the story veers dangerously close to Nicholas Sparks territory (cf. &#34;A Walk to Remember&#34;) and because the writers have Teller say unrealistic, screenwriterish things to teachers and employers.  But, still, this one is definitely a cut above.";05 22, 2014;A31LHED3SKLWVB;Darren;The real thing;1400716800

Brone is a fallen angel who pretty much stuffed up in hell and got turfed out of there as well.  After 800 odd years of walking the earth in banishment he is deprived in every sense of all contact.  When Evangeline (nice name BTW) runs into him the shock of feeling is almost too much for him.  But it's too good to be true.  His master wants her soul and Brone is just the fallen angel to give it to him.  In return for rescinding his banishment.Now Evie has something she wants more than anything, and the best possible reason for it.  All Brone has to do is take advantage of that and he is home and hosed.  But of course it is never as simple as that.For a short story this has quite a nice amount of character development.

Miracle-Gro 170025 Gro-ables Salad and Herb Garden Kit, 18 Seed Pods  (Not Sold in CA);B00C88DV6M;[0, 0];5.0;"We live in a townhouse with very little gardening space. Last summer I cleaned out our planter and setup a small garden with too much stuff. We got lovely jalape&ntilde;o peppers, not much else. This year I gardened in the front of the house and back, and so far we've had tomatoes, bell peppers, and jalape&ntilde;os. I keep learning something new and next year will do things differently. Having said all of THAT... this salad set is really ideal for me. I'm not familiar with gardening from seeds. I find this set a great place to start. Everything is set up so I can learn from this experience and next time I think I can do this all on my own from seed. My two boys really like to garden with me, so this is a great set for them to help me plant and watch grow. They get such a kick out of watching the tomatoes we already planted turn red and picking them.Aside from the 18 seed pot, there's a small instruction booklet and a sample packet ofMiracle-Gro 1008191 Shake'n Feed All Purpose Plant Food Jug, 4.5-Poundspecific for Tomato, Fruits, and Vegtables + calcium.

My only concern is that I opened the box and it says I should store it in a cool place until I use it, but that it should be planted this year. I'm not sure if there's time to grow everything before the Fall. I probably needed this set in Spring or very early summer. So I'm not sure if I should risk planting it next Spring.";07 25, 2013;A2JKM8KF3296CW;"Ninjaba ""Ninjaba""";Great starter kit for the non-gardener.;1374710400

Carhartt Women's Portland Down Jacket;B00C9V8Q2W;[10, 10];5.0;I was hesitant to order this jacket because I could not find any reviews about it.  But I know Carhartt makes high quality items that you know will last year after year. It is very well constructed. The down (75%) and feather (25%) are all held in place so there is no shifting, with box stitching but it is not an obnoxious stitch design. The outer nylon shell is thick and water repellent so the down doesn't escape or the rain enter and leave the down soggy and smelly. To wash, you turn it inside out and I would recommend throwing in with it a few tennis balls to keep the jacket moving around in the machine. The hood is large and has a toggle so you can tighten it around your head and stay warmer. You can even zip it all the way up and tuck your chin inside.The Merlot color is a beautiful wine color. To me, it is a cross between a raspberry and a plum. I tend to wear a lot of black and grey and this is a very nice complement.Construction: Thick water resistant outer shell. Box stitching, elastic wrist cuffs, toggle at the hood and hip, 2 inner pockets, 1 of which is multimedia with a hole for earphones.

Transformers Energon Powerlinx Battles Scorponok;B00CBN18EQ;[0, 0];5.0;Keep in mind the other versions of this figure are arguably good including the origional which I own, this figure manages to encompass great features of vehicle and beast like characteristics.  The shame is this guy could have been made bigger, and his robot mode looks impressive but his vehicle mode makes him look smaller.  Speaking of vehicle mode, he boasts tank treads, energon claws on the back of those, shovel type plows on the front of his treads. His Skorpion claws are crazy awesome, giving him wide range of grip, missiles, and energon blades on the outside of them.  He has scorpion inspired fangs but no eyes just a cockpit type thing on his back.  His tail has flip out guns and a hook...?...He has a jet mode, but its laughable in the great scheme of things, and takes his weapons away so I never use it or display him like that.His robot head boasts a visor like the origional g-1, me maintains his weapons pretty much the same in robot mode as in scorpion mode, in fact his tail works better in robot mode.  His tail can be used to stablize him, or fan flip up over his head to let him use his cannons.  His shoulders can go up or down as well, giving him options in robot mode, as if that wasn't enough he can use energon transformers weapons too, starscream and cruel lock's are preferable, but ravage's cannon work too.  He's bigger than beast wars skorponok and a chip off the old gen-1 block, and a great buy for anyone who likes the new decepticons inspired by gen-1.;04 14, 2013;ANT20YWR9RFU;"Matthew E.

Seidio BD2-HK3SSGS4K-BK with Metal Kickstand Case and Holster Combo for Samsung Galaxy S4 - Retail Packaging - Black;B00CBSYFF0;[2, 2];5.0;You will not find a finer quality phone case.  The fit of the case to the phone is remarkable.  This is my fourth Seidio case.  They are quite expensive, but they are the best.  My last case was a Surface, this is my first Active, which is a two part case.  The Active has a thin semi-rigid plastic shell that wraps around the softer rubber form fitting case. The phone's power and volume buttons are covered by the rubber case. It takes additional pressure to push the buttons due to the thickness of the rubber, but it is not a problem. The fact that the buttons are now covered by the case just makes them harder to find.  The phone can be turned on by the home button so I don't really use the power button anyway.If I had to choose between the Surface and the Active cases now that I have had both, I would probably choose the Surface due to its ease of removal.  I switch my battery fairly often requiring case removal and the Active case takes a bit of concentration to remove the outer layer.  It offers more shock resistance to falls than the Surface, but I rarely drop my phone.One last thing about the latest phones like the S4 is that the screen goes right to the side edges of the phone. The downside of this is that the case edge now interferes with finger travel on side edges. It's not a Seidio thing, it's just a drawback of spreading the screen so far.;05 26, 2013;A2GNTOCQLJGLNY;T.

I'm sure some of that seedy stuff will be there but it's not the main focus. It is a comedy not the normal serious drama about Politics in Washington DC. The funny lives of these 4 guys trying to keep their jobs and then come home and be roommates is hilarious.

Of course they will back policies they aren't particularly keen on to keep their tea party constituents happy, and say things even they find nonsensical because it's a party talking point. They also find that no matter how conservative they try to be, they get primary challenges from people from the wacky fringe.

;B00CENSU1W;[8, 22];1.0;"Aside from some good voice talent adorning this project, DC Animated's newest (and worst) film since its inception, THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX, is a bloody, violent, and all-around unpleasant experience based on one of the worst so-called ""Event"" comic arcs in recent years, Geoff Johns' five-issue FLASHPOINT.Since it essentially replicates most of what takes place in the comic (with the exception of the opening sequence), there's no point in really rehashing all of that nonsense. The animation is going further and further away from the more classical DC animation projects that have set the standard since BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES premiered in 1992 and more towards an anime/CG style that, while being more ""current"", is sometimes too kinetic to really appreciate detail, and even worse, the animation seems perfunctory. It's seems very unfinished, and there's no real joy to looking at almost any of the scenes. The vocal work from Kevin McKidd as the Thomas Wayne Batman and the always-enjoyable Nathan Fillion as Hal Jordan/Green Lantern stand out, but despite Michael B. Jordan (an actor I really like, and does good work here as well), I just didn't care any more about Cyborg than I would in an older episode of Cartoon Network's TEEN TITANS cartoon. In fact, I care even less, because obviously Johns has his pet characters that he likes to showcase, and Cyborg is definitely one of them.If this had been a feature based entirely around the Thomas Wayne Batman and the incredibly powerful story of the ""Flashpoint"" world that was crafted by Brian Azzarello and Eduardo Rizzo, or had at least more elements of that, I would have been significantly more pleased. But that's just personal preference and not much to do with the actual product.Jay Oliva, as a director, seems to be stepping backwards here, particularly from the amazing work he'd recently done with the very well-done DARK KNIGHT RETURNS two-parter recently released. He seems to be much less focused on storytelling and character than on showing a very brutal and horrific world and brutal and horrific things that former heroes are doing to each other. Another thing to discuss in this film is the violence. How is this film not R-Rated? There is more blood and eviscerations and decapitations and death than in most of the ""Hard R"" films out there, yet somehow this ends up being PG-13? I'm certainly no prude (one of my favorite films of 2013 is the NC-17 rated BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR), but that this could somehow be okay for children as long as there's a 13-year-old around just seems wrong.Don't get me wrong; I didn't set out to dislike this. I usually prefer the animated adaptations of what DC Animated has done with less-than-stellar story arcs, particularly with the two SUPERMAN/BATMAN films (PUBLIC ENEMIES and APOCALYPSE). It just still falls too far short of the mark, much like the comic did and leaves you with a foul taste in your mouth of things to come for DC Animated. With the departure of genius creator Bruce Timm from the DC Animated branch, the next upcoming film will be the first foray into the universe of the ""New 52"", called JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR, based on the first New 52 arc of JUSTICE LEAGUE, which is another just-barely-average arc from Johns and artist Jim Lee.I only hope that it will eventually get better. Maybe if they continue with the New 52, we can get an I, VAMPIRE film!It could happen...";08 9, 2013;A2BFIYZYNK54QX;"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""";"No better than the ""Event"" comic that spawned it.";1376006400
;B00CENSU1W;[1, 1];5.0;Just to get this known, it is very violent and raw, so I recommend previewing it before considering to let your children watch it.  Apart from that, This is such an awesome movie! I highly recommend it to anyone, even those not into comics. It holds a storyline that goes beyond the typical, presumed atmosphere of an animated comic movie, and holds focus more on a theatrical action movie. Being my favorite DC movie, yet! It draws on emotion, the consequences of acting on them, and the fight and sacrifice to put the pieces back together.So what ever you do, rent it, buy it or borrow it. Just make sure you watch it!

;B00CENSU1W;[2, 3];5.0;"&#34;God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.&#34;This well-known prayer plays a large role in this movie, as the Flash struggles to gain serenity and wisdom, at least.This is a (condensed) retelling of the major crossover event that DC came out with a few years ago. I've only read bits and pieces of that event so this will be a review of the movie on its own merits. The story begins with a young Barry Allen coming home to find that his house has been broken into and his mother brutally murdered. We flash forward (sorry) to the present day where an adult Barry Allen is putting flowers on his mother's grave, only to be notified that there has been a break-in at the Flash Museum. On arrival, he encounters a veritable rogue's gallery of his top foes, including the Top, Mirror Master, Heat Wave, Captain Cold, Boomerang, and the Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne).Thawne has hired the other Rogues to distract Flash while he carries out his plan, trapping Barry in a future-technology adhesive that will never give way, while he plants half a dozen bombs, on the various Rogues and on Flash, intending to erase not only Barry Allen, but also his museum and the surrounding city blocks. Barry manages to trap Thawne in his own adhesive but Thawne decides it's worth it to die if it means that Allen dies, as well. Allen summons the Justice League to assist but they are unable to handle the future technology and disarm the bombs. Flash tells them to take the Rogues Gallery members away to try to disarm the bombs away from the city, leaving Allen and Thawne behind. The various solutions are novel and the sequence is riveting.As Thawne is led away, another scheme in ruins, he drops a bombshell: &#34;Enjoy your petty little victories, Flash. For no matter how fast you run, you can't save everyone. Not the ones that matter to you.&#34; Allen is shocked as he puts two and two together. Batman tries to reassure Flash and asks him if he's okay. Flash responds: &#34;Don't worry about me, Bats. I'm fine. Nothing I can't run off.&#34;This was a terrific prologue, setting the stage beautifully for the story that is to follow. The next scene shows a groggy Barry Allen waking up at his desk at the Police Department. To his astonishment, he sees a breaking news report that &#34;Citizen Cold&#34; is battling Captain Boomerang. Barry runs off to put a stop to the struggle but finds, to his even greater astonishment, that his costume ring is gone, that he is unable to muster any speed, and that, as he trips on the steps leading out into the sidewalk, his mother is still alive.In the world in which he finds himself, his mother was never murdered, Iris West has married another man and has a child, Citizen Cold is a hero, the Flash never existed, a young Bruce Wayne was killed and his father, Thomas Wayne, has become a much darker, gun-wielding Batman, who's not above killing his foes. We also find out that Cyborg is a much more decked-out version, who has a role as a National Security Advisor, and who is trying to assemble heroes into a league, including Enchantress, Pied Piper, Citizen Cold, Shade, Sandman, and the Shazam kids. They're hoping to persuade Batman to join, in order to help them counteract the global war that has resulted from a fight between Atlantis and Themiscyra, where Aquaman has flooded Western Europe and Wonder Woman has invaded the United Kingdom and renamed it New Themiscyra. The new league has to take out Aquaman and Wonder Woman to stop their war before it overwhelms the planet.Barry's next move is to Gotham City. He needs answers and he figures that Batman is the most likely candidate to help him. He breaks into the Wayne Manor, and into the Batcave,where he finds a very angry Batman. Barry tries to convince him of the truth, that something in the past has caused the present to be drastically altered. And if this isn't corrected, the world may come to an end. Allen persuades Wayne to give him a chance and they try to recreate the accident that led to him becoming the Flash in the first place. After one spectacular failure, a second attempt succeeds.Meanwhile, in New Themiscyra, Colonel Steve Trevor is on the run. He was unable to locate the resistance or the &#34;package&#34; he was supposed to meet (Lois Lane, a prize-winning journalist who has been gathering intel for Cyborg). He is caught by Diana, Queen of the Amazons, and after he has told what he knows under the influence of the Lasso of Truth, he is brutally hanged by that very lasso. In case it wasn't clear, this is most assuredly not a movie for young children.A somewhat similar mission, led by Deathstroke and Luthor, to find Aquaman's doomsday weapon, ends in failure as Aquaman wipes out the ship and its crew, including some meta-humans that were part of the search. Back in the U.S., Cyborg pleads for more time but the President declines to give him the time. The U.S. military will act now, attempting to take out the WMDs before Aquaman can use them.In a flashback with no words, we see snapshots of some of the events that led up to the present day. Arthur and Diana meet as rulers of two peoples but are smitten with one another and have an affair. Queen Mera catches them and is overwhelmed with grief and rage. She attacks Diana but is killed in the conflict between them. A bloodthirsty Diana cuts off her head and takes her tiara as her own. A grieving Arthur broods over the body of his queen. A young Bruce Wayne is killed in Crime Alley as his father subdues the gunman and his mother succumbs to madness. A spaceship from Krypton lands but it lands in Metropolis, too far away for Jonathan and Martha Kent to reach it. Abin Sur's ring doesn't select anyone on earth... Well, you get the drift.Time travel and altered future stores are practically a clich&eacute;, going back decades in science fiction stories. The best of these stories take a single pivot pint and then extrapolate from that point. What if Hitler hadn't invaded Russia? What if JFK hadn't been assassinated? What if the 2000 Florida vote count had gone the other way? I'm not going to reveal the tipping point, nor the individual who changed it, but I will say that the one major flaw in this film, as in the original comic, is that the tipping point has little to do with what happened next. They attempt to explain this by saying that when you break the time barrier, there's a &#34;time boom, ripples of distortion radiated out from the point of impact.&#34; It's ironic...all the unbelievable things in this movie and this is the one I have trouble with?Back to the movie: this is a dark, apocalyptic vision of the future, brutal and bloody. Barry watches, as one after the other, his allies are brought down and his hopes are dashed in an all-out war between the Amazons and Atlantis until, at last, the ultimate weapon is unleashed, destroying all before it. Barry has just one last desperate chance to save the world, a chance bought with the sacrifice of one of those allies. The coda on this film is very moving, a fitting end and a redemption of sorts.Despite my gripes about the tipping point, this is an all-too-believable conflict between two warrior peoples, between two stubborn and proud leaders, in a world gone mad. It's a riveting story, particularly for the comic book fan as we look for clues to what happened to our favorite characters in this world. Superman? Check. Hal Jordan? Check. And so on. The animation is superb and the voice acting is very well done. There are no major standouts other than, perhaps, Kevin McKidd as both Batmans, but there are also no weak links. The story is tense and exciting and, all told, this is easily in the top five of the DC Universe animated movies.";02 11, 2014;AZXFS8GCTSQ5R;NF;Days of future past;1392076800

HP Envy 4500 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner and Copier;B00CIDQ470;[3, 4];1.0;Please read your own customer reviews as seen on Amazon.com. You should find from the comments that it works great or not at all in the wireless mode.  In our case, it did not work in the wireless mode following assistance from Apple, HP and our ISP provider Charter Cable. No one could solve the problem and we are at least as computer literate as your average customer. So it sits in the bedroom as a standby printer to be used via a direct wired connection. When the ink is all gone, it will be dropped off for recycling at Best Buy. Repack and return for a refund or another draw for a good HP printer? Not a chance. Our pay grade is simply too hight to invest more time in a machine that costs less than $100.00. My suggestion to HP would be to screw down hard on antenna reception power, quality control, and reliability to avoid much probability of any customer receiving a printer that fails in the wireless mode.;03 7, 2014;AS3C8W8VTS5BI;Richard and Bonnie Alford;Wireless connection failure of HP Envy Printer;1394150400

Paula Deen Savannah Collection Aluminum Nonstick 12-Piece Nonstick Cookware Set, Red;B00CJGHJ0W;[0, 0];3.0;"This is a nice starter set of pots and pans for those who don't do a lot of heavy cooking or for college students, but they won't stand up to any serious cooking road tests. If you primarily boil water for pasta or heat up soup or make the occasional omelet, this is probably the perfect set for you; but these are not heavy duty pots and pans and you shouldn't expect them to behave as such.They are very attractive and the red coating with white enamel interior is really lovely, but they also scratch very easily. The instructions specifically tell you not to cook on temps higher than low-medium and NEVER use metal utensils on them or you will scratch the coating. I've been careful and we've still managed to scratch the surface on 3 of the pans after just a month of use. I was surprised how challenging it was not to use any metal on them (no quick stirs of your soup with a spoon, no whisking in flour unless you have a nylon whisk). They are also very lightweight (the largest pot only weighs about two pounds) so they are good for light jobs, but I wouldn't simmer a stew in them for hours.The nonstick coating has thus far been fantastic and they wash up in seconds with no scrubbing (love that!) but I read the instructions carefully and you must be careful never to put them through the dishwasher or use nonstick spray or scratch them lest you damage the non-stick coating. I also appreciate that the lids on the pots are all clear so you can see what's going on without removing the lid.All in all, this is a decent starter set for the price. They are relatively inexpensive so I wouldn't hesitate to buy a set for a camping trailer or as a wedding gift, but if you're an experienced cook who wants to sear a steak or slow-cook a stew, these may not be heavy-duty enough for you.";07 6, 2014;A3LKLGZZ8OWR51;SiobhanK;Nice starter set for light jobs, but scratch easily;1404604800

;B00CK51JT4;[0, 0];4.0;"A fine and even smattering of standard erotica clich&eacute;s prevented this book from being what it might have. But the flow and pacing were good enough, the two main characters interesting enough, the plot engrossing enough and the sex certainly hot enough to make me in no way sorry I bought it. I don't think the story is impactfull enough that I'll remember much detail since it's not the kind of book that ""stick with you"", so it might even be worth a re-read in a couple of years. While the plot is engaging with elements of action and danger, it's not one of those books that's so impossible to put down you end up being rude and pissing off your boyfriend (I'm sorry honey, were you saying something?). So I actually plan to read books like that if I know I'm going to be being interrupted, like when at the beach with family. So, a nice, sexy, summer beach read.In the end I decided to give His Risk to Take 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.

;B00CK51JT4;[1, 1];4.0;"This novella is a doozy of a romantic suspense with just an edge of naughty goodness.  From the moment of first contact, sparks fly between these two stubborn, hard-headed characters and the adrenaline-inducing fun begins. Being from opposites sides of the law, there is plenty of conflict to keep the tension tight and the bedroom scenes are just incendiary.Troy Bennett is running, running away from the guilt of not being able to protect his partner and prevent his death at the Chicago PD.  Now he in NY, on the job, and continues to build that emotional wall around him.  Sauntering into his life comes Ruby, a homegrown pool hustler who has been known to skirt the law a time or two.  They meet not in a professional capacity, but by chance at a local bar and we are off to the races.  Troy may be full of sweet, but in the bedroom, he is all about control.  He commands, directs, and demands...all the things Ruby would normally hate, but coming from him, it is all about foreplay.  Despite the short length, Ms. Bailey manages to reach a ""good enough"" level with her characterization and drama, but I can't help but think that if this were a full-length novel, the story would be flushed out more.  I really felt the need for MORE!  Still, I thoroughly enjoyed this story and see myself visiting this story again and again.IN A NUTSHELL: Enjoyable, fast, and sweat inducing, I recommend this book for those who want a quick weekend read - but not necessarily in the company of people.

Having read both REFLECTIONS and THE VENUS EFFECT (REFLECTIONS), I recommend readers enjoy both, in order.  I suspect they could stand alone, though.I found the title confusing.  The reference wasn't well known to me...but Google revealed a nice explanation.  (See Wikipedia)I had an excellent introduction to Tammy in the 1st short story, so seeing more of her personal nature in this story was very rewarding.  While both stories are short, they cover months and months of time, allowing the tales to unfold naturally and a sweet romance to develop over time.  I really enjoyed watching Doyle come to realize that Tammy had become *everything* to him...truly the center of his life.  It took him awhile, but he realized he loves her, not just as friends, but as a man who's found the one woman for him.Sensuality level: mildLanguage: clean (REFLECTIONS, short story #1 has very typical soldier-in-VA-hospital-recovering language, Rated R...so this came as a bit of a surprise)Kudos to Ms. Lombardi!

Hoover WindTunnel and Tempo Allergen Cloth Type Y Vacuum Bags - 18 Pack - Similar to Hoover Part # 4010100Y, 4010801Y and 43655082 - Made ZVac;B00CLXN5GA;[1, 3];1.0;Upon arrival, I compared these what was received to the product description and picture.  The bags received do not have Zvac branding (there is no brand listed).  The cardboard retainer ring on the bags provided is not squared as shown in the picture, but rather was tapered at the bottom, which is a big deal because the retainer clip on the my Windtunnel will probably not fit properly with the bags that were shipped.  The bags say they are Type Y/Z and are much bigger than the type Y bag in the vacuum.  The product description says these are only Type Y size (no mention of Z), so that was false advertising.  Also, the description says they are made of cloth.  They look like paper although I admit I did not open the plastic as I don't want to jeopardize the ability to return these.  Bottom line is I took a gamble and lost because the description is dishonest.  I am returning these without even trying them.  Had the size been right, I would have at least given these a try even if they are paper because the price is very good.

I have owned one for each of my previous devices, S2, Note, S3, S4 and now the Note 3.  It is nice to see them going with Eco-packaging but wish they would go back to the days of including all the extras like the screen protector, the little lanyard thing, the little padded inside of the case, etc even if it does mean spending an extra couple bucks. I still love it though.  A welcoming surprise is that they finally decided to cover all sides and edges.  The top and bottom are now covered. Previously, these cases only covered the sides leaving the top and bottom exposed.  This was huge for me as I like the entire phone surrounded by the case. Still love it. When you buy Rearth, you have to know what you're getting. I love thin, sleek, minimal cases that offer some very small protection.  If you're looking to purchase something that will protect your phone from drops and throws, look elsewhere.

As you may, or may not know, with my backround in Central American politics, an Island can come in very handy. However, the upkeep of any Island, what with the weather, earthquakes, occaisional peasant uprising, (those I can deal with), electricity, gardening, attempted military junta overthrow, (once again, can deal) almost make the purchase of an entire Island a bit daunting. Well, once again, the USA has come to my rescue. Seems that leasing, as opposed to buying, is an excellent tax haven, so, VOILA!!, I leased an Island in the Kareeb!!! And not just any Island, but one that I'm already vaguely familiar with! And where do these lovely, bargain basement priced, trinkets from Amazon come in? Simple. My new Island is filled with peasants, and, I need to closely monitor their behavior.

;B00CNENFXA;[0, 0];5.0;"I long awaited the release of Tony 's 1960s Dot albums.  The first 12 cuts comprised  the LP Tony Martin His Greatest Hits in which George Greeley arranged 12 of Tony 's most famous recordings of the 1930s, 1940s and 50s. Here you find great stereo arrangements of  Tony 's No. 2 Billboard hit ""There's No Tomorrow"" (which later for Elvis became It's Now or Never), No. 3 hit "" I Get Ideas"", No. 4 hit ""To Each His Own"", No. 5 hits ""Here""  and ""Tonight We Love"", No. 6 hit ""Kiss of Fire"" as well as the 1939 Decca No. 16 hit ""South of the Border"".The second half of this CD is comprised of Tony 's  LP  Fly Me To the Moon.  This LP is more or less  a compilation of Dot singles.  La Novia, in its English version was released as a  Tony Martin single in 1961 years before it became a worldwide hit as ""The Wedding"" in a Julie Rogers recording.  Surprising in this case  the LP recording is in the original Italian while the single was in English in the US.  The flip side of this 45  was ""Orizzonti Di Gioia"" (Horizon of Joy).  Don't Worry is the Martin Robbins song which in its original by Marty was a major chart hit in the spring of 1961.  Tony 's single was undoubtedly released to capture the pop radio market but the Robbins record was a major country and pop hit leaving the Tony Martin rendition little heard. The flip side was  Billy Vaughn's ""To Be Alone"" which was a Top 10 Billboard hit for the Hilltoppers (of which Billy was then a member) in 1953.  In Other Words (Fly Me To the Moon) was released as a single in 1962 with ""The Rest of My Days"" as the flip.  I'll Be Seeing You was also a 1962 single with Alfie as the A side. The other surprise is the Leon Rene title ""Convicted""  a great ballad which I don't believe charted any where in the US although it received lots of radio play in a Modern Records recording by Oscar McLollie and His Honey Jumpers.  Leon Rene was writer of the Patti Page famous 'a' side ""Boogie Woogie Santa Claus"" which became the 'b' side to the biggest hit ever ""Tennessee Waltz"".All in all this is a great collection showing off the vocal skills of one of America's favorite male vocalists.";02 6, 2014;AQLKDH87A6M3F;"Bill Busse ""in the attic at bill's""";Great Tony Martin from the '60s!;1391644800

;B00CP7M572;[1, 1];4.0;"Oh this book was so short. I read it in about 3 hours. I wish it was longer because I loved every minutes of it. I didn't want it to end. OK, so we have Goldie Locke who works for the three Baehr's. I see the irony in this. LOL Someone is killing magical creatures and Goldie is not going to stand by and watch it happen. She was so determined and cared for the animals so deeply, it was hard not to like her. Well, to make things worse for her, she has to work with an Ordinary, which is a human. She is not supposed to let him find out about her, but a lot of things don't go according to plan. As they get closer to the killer, the killer gets closer to Goldie.Someone's time is up and Goldie hopes it isn't hers.So I literally can't wait to start the next book. I want to learn more about Goldie and what she has become, as well as two hot hunks. ;) There were a lot of magical creatures and hopefully in the next, we will learn more about them as well. There were pink elephants, zombie chickens, three headed dogs and much much more. This whole world is new to me, not reading Goldie's sister's Cindy's books. We get to see quite a bit of the world in this one but not all of it. Now, all I need is the second book to continue my love for Goldie and the three Baehrs. :DGoldie is five feet tall and all attitude. She is an earth witch and a lawyer, who happens to be very short. What she doesn't make up in height she makes it up in being tough and smart. She knows she is cute and doesn't like it when people call her that, but she will use it to her advantage if necessary.Kodi is one of the Baehrs. He is the youngest of the three and has dated Goldie for the past three years, until recently. He really is cute, sweet and cuddly bear. :D Mmmmm He is a little stuck on himself though. That's why they broke up or as Kodi would say, why she broke up with him when he didn't want to. I really liked Kodi and I think he really does love Goldie. He just needs to show it more. I also hope she ends up with him. SQUEEDonovan is the ordinary. He has no magic and is a cop/detective. He is working the case with Goldie to find the sick sick man responsible for all the brutal deaths of the magical creatures. He is one of those guys that go out of their way to look unimpressive, to not be noticed and he is a pro at it. He hardly ever lets his guard down. So when we do see the other side, it makes us like him. :D At first he is a bit of a jerk but once you get to know him, he is an alright guy. Don't get me wrong, I really like him, but I don't thin he is right for Goldie.";09 19, 2013;A23PK0T3WEK4DN;Book- Marks The Spot;Very cute read- wish it was longer!;1379548800

If you are downloading the Mac version be prepared to allow it over night AT LEAST to download, maybe longer.I noticed another review where the person had trouble with it saying that her computer didn't have the original Sims 3 and I also had this issue, but I literally just pressed it until it finally worked. That and the remarkably long download time were annoying, but not deal breakers!

;B00CR4W1XG;[1, 1];5.0;I love to read books to my kids that have a lesson at the end and this book does just that! It talks about the importance of being nice to others and how easy it is to make friends when you do. Since you can never talk to your kids enough about the importance of empathy, doing for others and making new friends, this book is the perfect way to end a long day on a positive note.

SKLZ Dry-Erase Coaches' Board;B00CU9U8QU;[3, 4];1.0;This is a large, dry-erase clipboard that is about 1/3rd larger than a legal-sized clipboard.  The board comes with a dry-erase pen but has nowhere to clip it.  It would have been nice if it came with a string or chain to attach the pen or a clip that went along the side of the clipboard.I see a lot of potential for a board like this.  Great visual appeal and a good layout allowing coaches to share strategies with their players.My main issue with this is the paint that is coming off the edges (black paint).  This is rather cheaply painted on and this board would NEVER hold up to being used on the field, tossed around, etc.  The paint job looks nice from a design perspective but the quality is just not there.  I don't know if a sealant is required or an entirely different material, but I am concerned about the safety and contents in that paint.I would avoid this board, it's hard to tell if this is a lead based paint or not.  Either way, I am not keen on the black and gray flakes on my fingers just from light handling.1 star.;07 29, 2013;A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8;"Diana De Avila ""MS Gkygrl""";Paint coming off the edges out of the package!;1375056000

Satechi USB Portable Amazing Humidifier v.1;B00CUQBD12;[10, 10];5.0;**Update: You must follow the directions and soak a Q-Tip in white vinegar and clean the nozzle. My Satechi was slowing down and not putting out as much mist. A through wipe with vinegar and I'm back in business.**This portable humidifier exceeded my expectations. I've been using it in my forced hot air-heated office for almost two months. I have indoor allergies and have had sinus surgery so life is more pleasant with less-dry air. It does a great job of putting out cool mist without making everything damp. The auto-shutoff is also a very nice feature in case you forget to unplug it. Personally, I have not tried screwing it into a water bottle (the reviews say to use Evian). Instead, I use a wide-mouth cycling bottle and rest it on top. The weight of the water makes a solid base. On a large, wide-mouth bottle, the humidifier will only use the top third of the water before it shuts itself off, so the unit stays steady. It does have a faint blue light, which is barely perceptable if you're sleeping next to it.I do use municpal water that has been run through a Brita filter. I'm not sure if that makes a difference, but I have yet to have an issue with this and am thrilled that I have it to ease the dryness in my office. If you allow the filter to dry out completely between uses, it will take several minutes for it to moisten up enough to really get going. Once it's damp again, it will be cranking at full capacity!;12 9, 2013;A38GA471F45H4X;"Erin J. ""Erin J.""";Fantastic unit! Great ease of use and portability.;1386547200

The only downside to this product is that it's a bit wrinkled... but it's no major problem.PLEASE READ:Upon reading other reviews, people stated that it was too small for them upon choosing their size. I'm a 13 year old girl and I'm pretty short, so I got myself a large. It fitted absolutely perfectly! A recommendation would be to order a size or two bigger than what your measurements add up too.TO SEND THEM YOUR SIZE:Simply go to your orders under the YOUR ACCOUNT tab, and click on &#34;Contact Seller&#34; next to the product.

Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 (8-Inch, White) 2013 Model;B00D02AHEO;[0, 0];5.0;My Wife had been wanting a Tablet for the last few months so I tried to figure out which one of the Samsung tablets to get.  At the end of the day it came down to the Tab 3 and the Note tablets.  From there I had to decide what size she would want.  I took a chance on the 8 inch because I felt the 7 inch might be too small and the 10.1 might be a little to large to carry around.  The 8.0 does the job perfect because its large enough to really enjoy the screen size and the bright display and small enough to carry around or put neatly in a bag.;04 16, 2014;A2OPBERUFGEM75;Chris;Just what my Wife needed.;1397606400

Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 (8-Inch, White) 2013 Model;B00D02AHEO;[22, 27];5.0;"Everyone has needs to meet when selecting a tablet, and I had mine.After owning inexpensive yet serviceable tablets in the 7"" and 9"" sizes. I wanted one that was a step or two above them in functionality, especially, a GPS to use with offline nautical navigation. I evaluated my 7"" and 9"" tablets, to see if they would allow me to travel without my netbook. Of course I had to bring along the netbook until the issue was settled.The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 model had been tempting me, but the proprietary power and USB connector was not to my liking. Samsung made the right move by going to a standard micro-USB connector for power and peripherals with the Tab 3 products.The next question was the 7"" vs 8"" model? SGT3-8 has a very thin bezel, and is lightweight, so it's fine for holding to read a book, or browse the web. It comes with a higher screen resolution than the 7"" model (1080x600) and is the same as the 10"" version = 1080x800. That means you can cleanly view 720P video. The SGT3-8 has more memory, a faster CPU, is the thinnest of them all, and has better cameras when compared to either the SGT3-7 or the SGT2-7. Thus, I justified the extra cost, with a larger screen area as well!The SGT3-8 has met every need so far:- Able to play MLB-TV's ""At Bat"" with a great picture, and no hesitation.- With the InstaTV Pro app, plays streaming TV from my HomeRun HD dual streaming tuner, I can watch real-time local TV stations.- The MX Mariner App, displays my position on (free) RNC nautical charts from NOAA, even if hundreds of miles offshore. It's a great back-up to a chart plotter.- After a sea or land voyage, airline apps will get me a ticket home.- Plays Amazon Prime Instant video. (after installing an archived [11.1 for Android 4.0] flash player)- It fits in my purse, with minor impact!I installed a 64 GB class 10 HDXC memory card to hold a load of movies, music, and my own high def video files. Of course that also receives the photos and video from the built in cameras.The screen looks great, the audio is as expected. I quickly adapted to the Samsung rendition of Android. The tablet comes with 4.2.2, so it's up to date.It works great with my Samsung UN55ES6100 TV. The TV's Soft Access Point can provide the WIFI signal to the Galaxy Tab, which in turn, can serve as in IR TV remote control. The Samsung ""Watch On"" app, serves as a TV guide, and you can switch to a show you browsed on the tablet, just by tapping a soft button on the app. The remote via the IR port, can also control my two older TVs that aren't ""smart"".With a ""Smart TV"", the SGT3 can play it's video content on the TV. I can play a movie that's on the SGT3's memory card, on the 55"" TV Screen, with no cables needed. Supposedly, I can display the TV's contents on the tablet as well, but I'm still working on that one.All in all, after a little expenditure of time & effort learning about it, this thing does everything I need. It could handle solo travel, but at the very least will be a compact, light, and capable backup for my Samsung NB30 netbook.";07 18, 2013;A1ZBUGW8NT7BO6;Laura Mason;Good for home and away;1374105600

;B00D09AZXU;[1, 1];5.0;"I came a little late to the party. I've only recently purchased Thegodmachine and their EP but even from those albums I could tell Phinehas was headed in the right direction. From the start they were ahead of the Metalcore curve, if only by a small margin. What set them apart, to me, was the guitar work and the lyrical content. Breakdowns, gang chants and catchy riffs are almost a standard in Metalcore today, but Phinehas, from the start, brought blazing solos and easily accessible lyrics that did not compromise their overall message.With ""The Last Word..."" they set out to improve their own sound instead of the popular trend of changing styles or experimenting with salsa breakdowns (ABR, I'm looking at you... no hard feelings! :P). Phinehas have stepped every department up in this release. The drums pack a punch and that's partly due to the mixing being so in-your-face. I'm sure that their drummer changed a few things himself as well as his drum set just sounds fuller this time around. The riffs are more memorable and the solos are just brain melting! The lyrics are still as great as ever and the Choruses will have you singing along in no time flat. Even as I type this I'm singing the chorus to ""The Deepest of Graves"" in my head.

I just came from a really small Blackberry so switching over was a very different experience. Instead of keys, I had a touch screen, large enough for me to read comfortably in, and finally the ability to use more apps! (Using apps on the small blackberry was pretty... difficult). I really enjoyed the phone for about a few months, and then I grew tired of it.Because Windows had just started up, there weren't many apps in the store for me to purchase that I could actually use, and the &#34;bulkiness&#34; of the phone began to irritate me. But to be honest, After sticking with this phone for two years and going, I've come to really appreciate this &#34;discontinued&#34;, &#34;out-dated&#34; Nokia model.Firstly, this is my first windows Nokia phone. I don't know about any of the other series, so I really can't compare them for you, but I do know that I am incredibly grateful for how sturdy this phone. Two years, and all I have is a minor crack on the front screen from dropping the phone on it's touch-screen face to the concrete floor. Once, out of the many, many, many times I've dropped this phone -- and I only got one irrelevant crack. Mind you, this is a decently sized crack -- but I'm also saying that the damage could've been much much worse had it been a more fragile of a phone build. In this way, the fact that it's a little &#34;bulky&#34; is a little good.Because you can switch out the shells on the back of the phone, you can always replace your old dirty scratched up one for a new one, and they aren't that expensive -- incase you wanted to change the color, or if you simply wanted to replace it. The accessories aren't too expensive compared to that of many other updated smart phones because this one is discontinued. Thankfully I was able to buy a wireless charging shell for this phone while they were still available - for a very decent price. The product is good too [http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Wireless-Charging-Shell-CC-3063/dp/B00AOU49SK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1405117706&sr;=8-2&keywords;=wireless+nokia+charger+shell].So, after two years of using this phone, this phone does glitch from time to time. There were moments when the texting kinda &#34;freezes&#34; up on the phone, and you have to go back to the main menu, reclick the tile to text, and hope the phone gets over its own glitch. It's pretty minor, in my opinion, and for me I was able to work past it so it wasn't a big deal. You get to add a SD card for more space, so by just popping a 16GB or 32GB baby in there, you can have quite a bit of luxurious space to stock up on photos, music, the like. Camera-wise, there are a lot of phones with a better camera quality than this one now, but I'm still content with it. No one looks awfully discolored or anything like that.In terms of apps NOW, Windows has been working very efficiently to get the hottest apps available first, such as Wellsfargo (banking), Facebook, Twitter, all that social media, Evernote, Amazon, etc etc. Before I was a little irked at the lack in apps, and certainly it is still lacking in apps compared to the larger competitors out there (Apple and Android), but I don't think this will be as big of an issue in the future when Windows further close this gap too. Honestly I don't mind the lack of apps anymore either. There's less clutter and distraction when I do use my phone, and because of that the battery life sticks out with me.By the way, I really enjoy the battery life on this thing. You can literally go full day on a full battery, which is pretty sweet. It also has a &#34;Battery Saving&#34; mode you can activate in settings, which will really really help someone out if they wanted to be more efficient in battery use.Ultimately, it depends on what exactly you're wanting in a phone, so maybe my review might not answer what you necessarily want. Either way, I know I initially didn't really think too much of this phone - I really didn't, but I'm enjoying it more and more, and really hoping to see just how long this sturdy brick can last with me before I absolutely have to switch to another phone, or replace it, etc. Thanks for reading(:";07 11, 2014;A21ZMOHKFP4Y3X;Xi Xi;Sturdy!;1405036800

;B00D3AMM3W;[0, 0];5.0;"4.5 Stars.  I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. And I was inclined to gag, as I don't LIKE murder mysteries, and most thrillers leave me less than thrilled.I really enjoyed this book, the first I've read by Kassandra Lamb. The set-up was believable, the action fast-paced, the actions of Dr. Kate and her P.I. spouse and inner circle believable.  There were love scenes between Kate & Skip, but the ""heat level"" was mild/spicy, rather than extremely steamy. If those scenes are what you're looking for, you may be disappointed, but I thought this story worked great without them.I got bogged down a bit in the middle; there were SO many people helping and guarding and taking on a contributory role it was hard for me to tell who was on first. Kate herself seemed to fade into the background, the only action she took - cleaning. (Ugh!) In fact, I would say that the real heroine in this book (character role that would get the most screen time, if this was a movie) was probably Rose - but I LIKED Rose, so that wasn't an issue for me.I did figure out early on who the baddie must logically be (another reason I generally don't like this genre much), but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book. Despite being the fifth book in the series, it worked well as a stand alone, a sign of good writing.

;B00D5XYWC6;[2, 3];4.0;"I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.I do love a good romance wrapped in suspense. What hooked me first about this book were the dynamics between Madelaine and Grey. She's a little lonely and insecure at court, a situation only exacerbated by the Queen's callous regard and her fellow ladies' scorn, but she still stands out as a kind, brave individual with a strong sense of duty and good within her. Grey, however, starts off as dissolute and quite the reprobate, but it quickly becomes clear that his rakish conquests have only been a cry for his father's earnest affection.So without spoiling too much, we got a plot twist! As these two meet again at court and embark on a budding romance, Grey learns a few family secrets and soon becomes embroiled in a special service to the king. From this point onwards, the novel gains an additional layer of secrecy and intrigue. Many historical suspenses have a clear-cut good and bad, but I liked that the sides were all murky shades of gray (pardon that pun!). At times, it was hard for me to distinguish who was in the right and who was in the wrong- and I liked that. It added an extra dimension to each character as they all fought to protect their loved ones and their country. My heart went out to Grey and Madelaine for having to choose between their allegiances and each other, but I knew it'd end happy for them ;)I really liked the atmosphere created by this special mix of romance, suspense and intrigue. It was a gripping story- I couldn't put it down until I had finished it around 1 in the morning! And I can't wait to read the fabulous supporting cast get their stories told to. I hope Edward gets one!Anyways, it's a fun read that definitely keeps the reader guessing. I totally recommend What A Rogue Wants if you love a good romance with a side of mystery, suspense and intrigue!";06 16, 2013;AM9E8MNA0YA2U;Amazon Customer;romance wrapped up in suspense!;1371340800

It is well written, though as with most self-published books, it could use some proofreading. But this does not distract from a good story.I read H. Beam Piper's Space Viking many years ago. After reading the first book in the trilogy, I dug out my copy of Piper's book, just to see how close the author followed the original. The characters and style are close enough that they could have been a later work of Piper's, if he had not died too soon. The second book continues the good work of the first book by Wehr.

;B00D7H1CMS;[1, 1];5.0;"Just reading the introduction of this book is a real eye opener as it defines what the real value of this book is.I have actually been using this book for over 30 years. The reason I purchased it as a Kindle is so I can use it more easily in writing sermons. My latest sermon is ""The Bible in One Word is You!"" Turner quotes the founder of Unity, Charles Fillmore, as saying that the bible is the story of man's generation, de-generation, and re-generation. In other words, the true purpose of the Bible is our story of a search for God and who and what we are in relationship to God. So I conclude that the Bible in one word is you, or most useful in a personal way is to say, ""The Bible in one word is ME!""Reading the Bible with this in mind will reveal that all the great and even ""terrible"" things that happen in the Bible are really descriptions of the mental and spiritual aspects that each person goes through in discovering our true purpose and mission in life. Taken literally, many people won't be religious because they think God is not the kind of god they want to have. Taken metaphysically, we learn how we can become more spiritually enlightened because the stories describe the processes we go through as we advance in truth.For example, the Great Flood represents the grace of God that happens in spite of our poor intentions. The flood represents God cleansing us of negative, limiting ideas and beliefs that are keeping us from growing. It's a baptism, and defines what baptism really does. Daniel in the lion's den and David vs Goliath teach us that faith in God is our unfailing defense against any problem.Whether or not these stories actually happened, there are countless lessons like these we can learn. Even the ones which are true, have deeper meanings for us to learn. Let There Be Light makes the every page of the Bible meaningful to mankind and removes any objection to worshiping God that the merely literal stories tell us. Give it a try!";10 22, 2013;A13I729IPODO2H;Aldon K Samaha;Great book for understanding the overall meaning of the Bible.;1382400000

ASICS Women's GEL-Kayano 20 Lite Show Running Shoe;B00D86CY8Y;[0, 0];5.0;If you love Asics and love the color then that's really all I need to say. These are the Kayano line, so they have I believe the most support of the Asics brand of running shoes- which is perfect for me as an overpronator. If you're not sure about the fit, check out their website as they describe the level of support for each line. I've been wearing the Kayano's for several years now, and each one fits as good as the last (though I did take a hiatus from the line the one year they put the laces up the side of the shoe instead of slightly off center, but I'm guessing a lot of other people did the same as the next year they were back to slightly off center).I'm more a speed walker than a runner, and more a sprinter (after my 2 year old) than a cross country runner, and I've never had any problems with the Kayano line regarding shin splints, lower back pain, tendonitis, etc. But given my history of feet problems summarized as an overpronator, I know running shoes are such a personal fit. Honestly, I love Zappos for their free returns, so if you've never tried Asics or the Kayano brand, I would say try there first, unless Amazon/a vendor will offer free returns. I felt confident enough in the shoe to purchase it here, and was no disappointed at all.;07 14, 2014;A1T50IO1EMVNFH;Hegel Who;A tried and true shoe;1405296000

Picamilon (sodium salt) - 40 Grams (1.41 Oz) - 98+% Pure - FBA;B00DCE3G5C;[1, 1];5.0;I am an insomniac nurse who was left high and dry when the company that makes my prescription sleep aid changed their prescribing recommendations and I could no longer get it at the strength I needed it.  Maybe some of you are familiar with it by it's generic name, Zolpidem.  It is a scheduled drug yet fairly nontoxic compared to others in it's class.  Short story is that I went two months last fall without a sound nights sleep while my doctor and I tried to find a replacement medication.  I finally started researching on the internet in the alternative medicine category and found Picamilon.  It was first formulated in Russia as an attempt to find a way to get the GABA molecule to cross the blood brain barrier.  GABA is one of the major sleep inducing brain hormones and also the one that is effected by Zolpidem.  A small dose is all I need to help me sleep like a baby.Thank you Liftmode for being there with the best product at the right price and at the right time for me.It has been well researched and you can read about all the particulars on how to use it on PubMed as well as other places on the web.

It's hard to get the phone out the case to charge, but it doesn't fall out like some other cases.  The blue gadget included works great and makes it easier.  The only improvement i would make to this product is to make it open the other direction. When I put it on my lanyard it is backward opening it.  It is probably more comfortable for a left handed person, but it hasn't stopped me from using it daily.  I can hold a little cash, about 4 cards and then I'm ready to go.

;B00DDWI7HU;[6, 6];5.0;Author Shirly R.L. and Illustrator Anahit Aleksanyan continue to create stories about an adorable little girl named Annie whose crowning feature is a head of curls. With wise writing and beautiful illustrations they offer a story that is not only fun for children (especially little girls who worry about such things) but also that has some very wise lessons.Annie greets her friend Mia whom she hasn't seen for a long time and the girls enjoy a day of playing with dolls, making a dollhouse, and putting on a show for their parents until Mia must leave at the end of the day. Annie loves Mia and thinks Mia with her straight blonde hair is beautiful, but when Annie looks in the mirror she notices now that her own hair is very curly: she wishes it were straight like Mia's and she attempts to comb and brush her curly locks to no avail. Despite her parents support that Annie's hair is beautiful in its curly state, Annie continues to attempt to straighten her hair by placing heavy books on her curls as she reclines in bed. Her father sits beside her and reminds her of a shared movie with penguins and the zoo with elephants and how they all look alike - and how boring the world would be if everyone looked the same. The next day Annie's now loved curls become the safety net for a falling little baby bird, proving that what her father said about being unique was absolutely right. And her supportive mother adds `What matters most is that you love yourself,' Even your curls!Books of this caliber are not only terrific bedtime stories for children, but they leave thoughts in sleepy heads about appreciating their own unique selves.

;B00DEM2BVM;[4, 4];4.0;This is a reasonable calculator that offers two operation screens.  The primary screen is the basic calculator screen and the layout is simple and clear.  The buttons are large and if you are using a tablet they are huge.  That portion of the calculator is not bad.  The calculator lets you enter the entire calculation including parenthesis and see it displayed on your device before you press the equal button. The CLR button acts like a Clear Entry button and helps you to back up and make corrections to the data you have entered before you press equal.By pressing the ADV button you go to an advanced calculator to use trigonometric and logarithmic and other functions.  While I like advanced calculators and have used them for many years as an engineer this one feels awkward to use with only the advanced functions on the ADV page and no ability to enter numbers without going back to the basic page.  With the massive size of the keys on this calculator, on a tablet, the keys could have been easily made multifunction and we have seen excellent examples of how to design advanced calculators with these features in the last month or so.What I like:* The user graphics interface is nicely done on the basic calculator page.* The buttons are large and easy to touch and read. Some apps I have used the buttons are so small that you literally touch two at a time.* It uses the full screen size of the Kindle Fire and on my Android tablet to give you a nice sized calculator view* The numbers in the result display are reasonably large and easy to read.What I don't like:* The number transaction bar disappears when you press equal and shows the result.  The display area is very large and I wish that they had left the line showing the entry of the formula you were calculating as well as the arithmetic answer of the formula.* Forget the shifting to the advanced page and use multifunction keys.  I found the going to an advanced page that didn't allow you to enter numbers to just be awkward and strange to use.If you are looking for a reasonable basic calculator with large buttons then this is a good one with no ads.  If you are looking for an advanced calculator then there are better options out there.As far as permissions are concerned this app uses full internet network access.  The game does contain Google Analytics which tacks your use of the app and can provide reports back to the developer and Google for marketing purposes.

Just be aware when you install updates to make sure no invasive permissions are added to the app. The app contains no adware or invasive permissions.;04 8, 2014;A1X1CEGHTHMBL1;jjceo;A good basic calculator but using the advanced functions seems awkward!;1396915200

The lid is so tightly fitted that the vegetables come out perfect in a few minutes.  Very impressive.The little heater underneath is just a standard hot plate with a curved surface to fit the bottom of the pan.

;B00DG9L4B6;[1, 1];5.0;"I just finished reading The Current Between us for the third time. That's how awesome the book and Kindle Alexander are. This is a story that you can just keep going back to time after time and it never gets old. I feel that it just gets better each time bk you slow down and enjoy what you are reading at least for me. Sometimes I read a book,so fast to get to the happy ending that I don't absorb it as it should have been. This is a true love story between Gage and Trent. They do not shy away from their feelings and chemistry for each other which I absolutely love. So many times there is so much angst between the MC's that they have to get thru before revealing their true feelings, usually at the end. Gage especially expresses his love and adoration for Trent almost immediately and you just catch yourself smiling and then you remember where you are and look to see if anybody is watching you smiling so much lol. They have such potent chemistry with and for each other that they cannot contain it. When they come together to make love or just right down raw sex it is explosive. This story is not completely without angst and a couple tears, but they resolve it fairly quickly and their relationship only prospers from there on giving you a wonderful HEA. Kindle is an auto click buy author for me. I don't even read the blurb before I'm punching &#34;buy&#34; on my kindle.

LEGO Friends So Sweet 16 inch Backpack - Purple/Pink;B00DGA9F5C;[3, 3];2.0;"Every year, I wait for Toys R Us to hold their backpack sale.  They always have a ton of character backpacks to choose from, and then they throw in a free lunchbox with purchase of a backpack.  My girls are young, and they love picking out new backpacks.  I was a little skeptical when my oldest daughter brought over this Lego Friends backpack, but she was so earnest that I could not say no.This Lego Friends backpack is soft and silky.  Its biggest benefit is that it has two main compartments, and the smaller front pocket.  It also has water bottle mesh pockets on either side.  There are even some Velcro flowers that can be affixed to the front for a personalized touch.My oldest daughter is in first grade, and she only brings home a couple of folders.  Sometimes, she would come home with her snowpants in her backpack.  They fit nicely.  As you can see, there was not a lot of weight being placed in the backpack.I noticed signs of wear a couple of weeks into school.  By Thanksgiving, the backpack was falling apart.  I was determined to get this backpack to the end of the year: the calendar year, not the school year.The backpack ripped in multiple places.  Most notably, it ripped between the zipper and the backpack in the second main compartment, and the lining on the front pocket tore away too.  After three months of moderate use, it looked like it had been used to hike the entire Appalachian Trail.I would not recommend this backpack for regular use at all.  I don&#8217;t expect these character backpacks to last for multiple years, but I do expect them to last for the school year.";01 8, 2014;AJLNRMQAPCTI9;BabyMo;Fell apart in three months;1389139200

Moen CSI YG0818BN Arris 18-Inch Designer Grab Bar, Brushed Nickel;B00DIEWVJS;[0, 0];4.0;"I picked this grab bar up for my father-in-law to use when he visits. He is a rather substantial man with a progressive neurological disease. I wanted something that was very stable but also attractive.Appearance: This bar is really lovely, it is 1 1/4 &#34; around and has about a 1 1/2&#34; clearance from bar to wall. My bar came in the brushed nickle finish which is perfect for my bath. (Matches other things such as towel racks, tp holder and so on.) The design is also pleasingly modern.Installation: As you might imagine, proper installation is key. The bar must be positioned over a stud unless you are using secure mount anchors. You will need a phillips screwdriver, a 1/8 drill bit on a drill, a level and a stud finder. The bar is secured with 6 screws and washers. (An allen wrench and extra screws are also included in the set.) You have to remove the bar from the &#34;SecureMount&#34; (hereinafter &#34;mount&#34;) flange, then get your support base secured in the wall and then reassemble the whole thing. It takes a bit of time and hassle but when safety is the key concern it is about what you expect.Functionality: Obviously where you position the bar is key in it being potentially life saving, assuming you position it correctly and install it properly, the bar is perfectly suited for helping those with disabilities get in and out of the tub and/or shower. One issue I do have with the bar is the corners. While they are not exactly sharp, they surprisingly straight. I can see them giving someone a good sized bruise if knocked against or  bumped into at the right angle. I will probably pad them up to be extra safe when my father-in-law is here and then leave them as they are when he is not. (The corners do contribute to the attractiveness of the bar.)All in all, I like this bar and think it is a great addition to the bath for those who have a need for it.Recommended but do watch placement and those corners!";12 5, 2013;A2J8289OOT5DE4;C.

;B00DLX761E;[2, 2];5.0;"It's a complaint you often hear: ""I just don't have time to exercise."" With so much on everyone's plate, a new style of high-intensity workout has come on to the scene. This DVD is part of that movement, allowing women to get their exercise done in 10-minute intervals and still break a sweat. Each segment has eight exercise routines that are broken up by 20 second rest periods (not really enough time to lose that raised cardiac state, but enough to allow you to keep going with yet another challenging set of reps).This DVD is not for beginners, although some of the exercises can be modified in intensity. Yet, when you are done doing one of these 10-minute segments, you will know that you have gotten your burn in. One of the best things about the DVD is that you can select the number and order of segments (even repeating segments) you want to do at any one time, then re-set for something different the next time.The five segments are targeted to different body areas. There's the basic High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) 101, a basic group of exercises to get you started. Then, there's Ab HIIT (for abs and core), Upper Body HIIT (for shoulders, arms, and chest), Rock Bottom HIIT (for hips and thighs), and HIIT Explosion, which targets increasing your metabolism.As for the overall style and music, the DVD works well. The instructor Lisa Kinder is a AFAA Certified Trainer and a NCSF Certified Personal Trainer. More than that, she has a personable and easy to follow style, encouraging her viewers throughout the routines, especially when it gets tough. The music is subtle, but uses upbeat dance rhythms to help facilitate the tempo needed to complete the exercises at a brisk pace.This isn't the easiest exercise video to complete, but once you've followed all the segments, you know you've gotten a great workout.";10 7, 2013;A3INP7V12E2VDK;"Christine Zibas ""AnythngArt""";Not for Beginners, but a Great Workout;1381104000

"Aerb&reg; Wireless Bluetooth Speaking Mouse with Speaker Speakerphone for Bluetooth Enabled Devices (HID &amp; A2DP)--Purple";B00DN27H58;[0, 0];4.0;I bought this mouse from Amazon, after learning about it from AppyGeek, as one of their recommended products.It certainly is a great speaker/microphone, and a functional mouse. I had a bit of trouble with the mouse portion of it, in the beginning, as it was not pairing with my computer. After much technical support from Aerb (Mr. Frank Liu), I realized there was something wrong with my Windows 8 mouse driver, and decided to do a clean reinstall of windows 8. This reset the whole system, and I now can use the mouse and speaker/mic without trouble.Physically, it is only slightly heavier than a normal mouse, and the size/shape is comfortable for a right-handed grip.For people on the go, and need to minimize weight when traveling, I would certainly recommend this device. The speaker is fairly loud, and is very clear, with no distortion.;09 8, 2013;A2OWGXKHEDRRA;Mervin;Good hybrid device;1378598400

Samsung OEM Universal Micro Home Travel Charger for Samsung Galaxy S3/S4/Note 2 and Other Smartphones - Non-Retail Packaging - White;B00DPIKE3M;[3, 3];2.0;When we will all learn?  If you want an OEM Samsung product, buy it from Samsung.  I just bought two of these chargers, and they are definitely counterfeit.  They are at least 1/3 slower than the original Samsung charger which came with my Galaxy S4, the cord is at least a foot shorter, and the part that plugs into the wall seems to get very warm (unlike the OEM Samsung charger).  Anything that ships from China on the Amazon web site is probably counterfeit, and Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for hosting vendors such as this one.;03 8, 2014;A32UH0IHO7ALHK;Rochelle Chartoff;Not a Samsung product;1394236800

ClearMax LED2+ Home Theater LED Projector (Black);B00DQCMNEU;[6, 6];3.0;"This projector is okay: That would sum up my experience with this device. If I were to delve deeper, I would have to say this projector feels like something that would be a welcome addition to a student or teenager, whereas a movie buff looking to get that cinematic feel at home, should consider looking somewhere else.The Clearmax LED2+ is easy to set up; just plug in your a/v device, focus the lens and start using. It has some of the more useful cables included (VGA and RCA) and features a mini jack audio output, which is needed as the on-board speaker is as useless as they come.If the viewer can live with small but visible pixels, it does deliver a big image (more than 2m wide and 1.5m high/ almost 7ft x 4.11ft) at a  distance of roughly 4 meters (about 13 feet) so it is very usable, though it has a very noise fan which I didn't expect since it is a LED projector.Pros: - Easy to use- Works with some light in the room- Gives a rather large image in acceptable quality- Have all the connectivity needed, including the ability to play directly from a USB drive.- Power adapter works in the EU, just needs a standard PC power plug (appliance cable) and you are all set.Cons: - Weak speaker, and no easy way to turn the volume up or down, except for a mute button- Noisy fanOverall I would say it is a good fan for less than $200 as long as you can tune out the fan, or you hook it up to a sound system that can drown out the fan. If you like to sit in a not too brightly lit room watching a big image and you don't need HD, then this is a good cheap(ish) solution, otherwise you might want to spend a little more to get more.";12 22, 2013;A388PKT4N7O56E;Flemming H.

;B00DRPVE3M;[1, 1];3.0;"You cannot go wrong with Uno, it is the simplest card game yet. The game is great and just like the real card game. My problem is that while it is free to download, you have to purchase in-game coins just to play a match of Uno. You are given a few coins to begin with, but once you run out, you are out for the day. So while mobile games are to be enjoyed by anyone, and this game is enjoyable just like it's real counterpart; the in-app purchases are killing it for me. Just let me play it for as long as I want, how many matches I want, and I'd rate it all stars.Seriously, I can play The Sims and not purchase a thing to be fine, but the way Gameloft set this game up you have to purchase coins to actually play it!

If there was a little more to them, as in larger, I would probably feel that it was working a little better.  I like the Smoothies, but they are chalky.  I did not reflect this in my review, but it is quite curious why Amazon has the peppermint flavor of the same product for approximately 1/3 the price of the cherry flavor.

Cats Meow Yellow Undercover Fabric Moving Mouse Cat Play Cat's Toy As Seen on Tv;B00DSSA54C;[0, 0];3.0;"We got one of these for my cat for Christmas. She was ok with it until she tried reaching up under the skirt and got her paws smacked hard by the ball on the end of the wand. You could then take it out after a couple of days and she'd start getting interested, until once again getting smack by that ball. She wasn't really interested in chasing that red cord/wire thing as, I'm guessing, that's just the &#34;tail of the mouse&#34; in her opinion. It really wasn't the cat's meow as far as she seemed to be concerned. Anyone who has a cat and has seen them playing with a toy while showing absolutely no interest in others knows when their interested and when their not. And she was only marginally interested in it as it came.Then yesterday I decided I'd try and make it a little more to her liking. I took one of her toy mice (the kind that come in packages of five or more, have leather/suede strips for tails, are two toned in color, and rattle) that I know she loves to play with and some double stick tape and proceeded to tape the end of the mouse's tail to the end of the red cord/wire. I selected that particular type of mouse because it's small and lightweight, I figured it would not put a lot of extra strain on the motor if attached. Setting it down and turning it on got her attention again. She showed more interest in it now because it actually looks more like a real mouse running around. And it doesn't hurt her paws as much. Even as I've been typing this she's played with it a little and has caught the mouse. Which caused the motor to start whirring and her to release her catch.It's never going to replace me tossing out her toy mice to pounce on or whipping out a laser pointer for her to chase. But with a little help it becomes a little more interesting. If you're going to buy this first try to save yourself some money and check out places where they sell &#34;As Seen on TV&#34; products so you don't pay the extra in shipping and handling. And if you're cat doesn't seem interested in it as it is, try adding something lightweight that they like to chase.";01 6, 2014;APF91U0CWORP;Richard Greenleaf;Needs help;1388966400

Magic: the Gathering - Fiendslayer Paladin (18/249) - Magic 2014;B00DUGPP88;[0, 0];4.0;Fiend Slayer is a mean little fellow. Some might say he's a tad weak with his 2/2 frame especially for 3 mana, but his abilities more than make up for this and his mana cost in the right situations. Right off the bat this lil' Pally chump blocks weaklings all the while gaining you life - a GREAT addition to already existing creatures such as Voracious Wurm or Archangel of Thune who benefit from life gain. He's also immune to red and black spells played by your opponents which (for me) really makes him a go to dude. Oh and he has FirstStrike, fun!Managed to trade a play set off a few friends, worth using in any white-weenies deck.;10 17, 2013;A2583O1GD0ASRO;"W. T.

;B00DVLLIYW;[2, 2];3.0;I LOVE the work Griffen did with her C.G./Grace's POV Blogs. I was (am) amazed at her ability to refresh and revitalize a told story and make it so uniquely her own and a page turner. I am very happy for her that she bravely followed her dreams and published her first novel. I looked so forward to it. That being said I deliberated on posting my not so 'rave' review of it. But I believe all artist know they aren't going to please everyone and are interested in every opinion.I was drawn in quickly enough with the characters and thought she did a great job of defining each one. I very much like the varying POV chapters. At chapter 22 I was loving it. But by chapter 27ish I was beginning to find the relationship and the direction of the story so far fetched and quite unbelievable and not in a good way like FSoG.A 21 yr. old who is fiercely independent, highly educated, hard working and doesn't know ANYTHING about sex????  And hasn't been curious enough to have researched it at all despite her intelligence and social adeptness?? And this Sex God (10 yrs. her senior) is soooo ok with that?  And it just gets more ridiculous from there, actually driving off the cliff in the final chapter.I won't be purchasing the next book, but will continue to follow G.E. Griffen's career and would read future publications NOT associated with these characters.

Ok, I have to admit, I am a huge fan (more like obsessed) of her Christian Grey's POV Blog that I stumbled upon over a year ago. We'll get to that later, since this review is all about her first book, Starr Fated.Starr Fated had plenty of steam, drama, angst and a bit of 50 Shades. I did have a hard time (at first) connecting with the characters--their relationships came out of nowhere and it just didn't seem to click. And the end, has a slight cliffhanger, so I can't wait till Starr Destined! There were a few moments of British lingo that I didn't quite get a first, but did catch on. Overall, this was a great first book by the author and looking forward to more in the series.For more reviews, check out: An Asian & White Chick Walk into a Book Blogasainandwhitegirlbookblog.wordpress.com;07 16, 2013;A2H59CVVIH9886;Karmen;New Author!

ASUS PA279Q 27-Inch Screen LCD Monitor;B00DX64DBU;[2, 3];1.0;"I am the type of person who will research a purchase for weeks if need be, and I scoured every review on ALL 27&#34; IPS monitors.  There is no question in my mind that this is the best value monitor if you are a graphics professional or just want to see the best possible display from your computer.  I have stopped gaming after getting hooked for too many years so I really cannot comment on how this monitor would work in that situation (though my research told me it would not be bad at all).Immediately moving to what is relevant in this review, I purchased this monitor and a Display Port Cable so that I could take full advantage of the resolution AND refresh rate.  A HDMI cable will NOT do this, as the current standard will not display at 60HZ with the full resolution.  Note: A rather short Display Port cable is included, but since my computer is under my desk, I needed a longer one.Day 1.  I hooked up the monitor and got no signal at all via the display port cable.  The HDMI worked fine but again, at standards today, that is silly as the full muscle of this display cannot be used.  (HDMI 2.0 is coming, but you will need to wait until video cards have that capability).  I called ASUS tech support and we troubleshot the situation and both concluded that the monitor was defective and should be sent back.Day 3.  My replacement monitor arrived a day earlier than I had expected (Amazon was wonderful and sent it next day air) and I was all set to be up and running.  The first thing I noticed was that the surface of the monitor screen had a lot of 'debris' on it.  It looked as if someone had flossed their teeth and let the results stay on the display surface....ewww.  Now Asus does calibrate every monitor by hand, and you do pay for this (the 278 model is NOT professionally calibrated) so perhaps this tech person did this during lunch.  The slip cover to protect the screen was not secured and was mostly removed when I got the replacement.  There were some other things I noticed that now lead me to conclude, that if you return a NEW monitor for any reason, you will get a 'refurbished' monitor as a replacement.  (No I cannot prove this, but when you study the box it is apparent that it was not factory fresh with only the calibration done).  On other thing that disturbed me was that these monitors are put in another larger box to hide what is actually shipping.  (Theft concern?)  The replacement box was way oversized and came severely damaged.  I cannot believe someone would ship this (It was not Amazon) in that manner.  It took me 30 mins to stuff enough filler in the outer box to return it and repair the damage to the box....which leads me to ....I plugged in the monitor, hooked up the DPort cable and nothing....  I called Asus Tech and once again, we determined that the monitor was defective and needed to be returned.  Mind you, I now had 3 Dport cables and two monitors so we had 6 tries to find a hookup...none worked.  The HDMI cable worked on both monitors but again, you cannot get max refresh rate and max resolution unless you use a Display Port cable.  So everything was returned to Amazon, full refunds were issued immediately and I was back where I started.I would like to also note that the PA279Q included a calibration sheet for my monitor and the specs claimed that all Delta's would be below 2.0  (I am not sure what that means as I only use this display for regular work, but I assume it is a measurement to assure accurate color).  My replacement monitor had 5 measurement points OVER 2.0 and the other 8 or so were very close to 2.0.  I can only say that this adds to my thought that the replacement monitor was refurbished and not new, but I mainly base that conclusion on the way the monitor and accessories were packaged.Summary:  This would be the monitor to get but after 2 failures I decided to wait for the 27-28&#34; 4K monitors that are coming this year.  Shame on Asus for not testing the DPort connection prior to shipping.  How did they calibrate the monitor anyway?  Would they not have had to hook the monitor up to something with a DP cable?  Anandtech has the best review on this monitor, so if you want to take a chance on this you can read that review and sell yourself on this product.  Alas, my experience has been very disappointing for more than one reason and now makes me suspicious about what Asus is truly doing during the calibration phase which you pay almost $250 for (compare 278 vs. 279 price).";04 6, 2014;A1Y2CML4EWMCN4;PackerFan;Such high expectations shattered.;1396742400

Razer Hammerhead Pro In-Ear PC and Music Headset;B00DYNQR3O;[0, 0];4.0;"Razer is a company known exclusively for gaming, so the quality of these earbuds comes as a bit of a surprise. In this price range, they're a great choice for watching movies, listening to music, and playing games on the go.Sound quality is clear, although there is an obvious emphasis on bass (as is typical with Razer products). While not overwhelming, it does give the earbuds a definite slant towards low frequencies. This may or may not be a con depending on your preferences; for gamers or fans of electronic / hip-hop music, the Hammerhead is perfectly suited for the job.Microphone quality was perfectly adequate for a set of earbuds. While I didn't find it to be particularly exceptional, it did the job and picked up voices clearly and accurately.The aluminum buds feels solid and sturdy, while still remaining lightweight. They're comfortable to wear and do a pretty good job of blocking out external noise. While every ear is different, I personally found them very easy to insert and remove and had no issues with fit or comfort even over extended periods.These earbuds also feature Razer's trademark black and green color scheme, which may be a turn-off for those who favor a more conservative look. However, this is a non-issue as long as you don't mind the bright green wiring that runs through the product.One thing I would've liked to see is a built-in volume control along with the mic. The Hammerhead features only a single button for play / pause functionality, which makes it feel a bit incomplete. It's better than nothing, but it would be a lot more convenient with volume buttons.For the price, these earbuds are great for any gamer who also wants something for music and general-purpose use.";07 1, 2014;A3T3U4SX47PLR3;Faladran;Surprisingly great;1404172800

;B00DYUMCPY;[0, 0];5.0;I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I could not get my hands on this book fast enough!  I am absolutely in love with both of the series that come together in this book.  After picking this book up, I seriously considered calling out sick from work just to finish uninterrupted.Even after all the expectation I had for this series, I still don't think I would change a single thing about this book.  It was filled with all the things I was hoping for:  We get a good dose of James and Elise (in all their dysfunctional glory), answering all my questions about where they ended up after their last book.  We get to learn a little more about Nash, which is exactly what I wanted after completing his book.  Seth gets more time in the spotlight, to make up for him being away in the last book.  Some familiar supporting characters and references show up along the way, which makes me feel like a little fan girl.  Anthony is only present in small sections of the book (a plus for me, because I still hate him).  There is tons of action, which really kept the pages turning.  Lastly, the story was what I've come to expect from this author - great!I love a story that can keep me guessing until the last few chapters.  It's so rare that you can pick up a book, especially this deep into the series (or more than one series), and still be surprised at the twists and turns the author throws at you.

In PARABLE OF WEEDS Vande Zande proves that all of the suggestions, the hints, the matrices he spread before us - topics that reflected our contemporary life like a fractured mirror - were in many ways preparation for this dystopian view of the future. He looks around, observes that faces glued to mechanical devices that have entered our world as substitutes for interpersonal communication, partnered those observations with the obsession with consumerism as a desperate stance against the complete meltdown of our `economy' as we once knew it, and raises his eyes to engage us with a subtle and extraordinarily terrifying novella about where all of this - our current steps toward the future - could lead.Revealing too much of this story could dampen the impact the author achieves. It is the tale of Ian, a single father (his wife died young from a debilitating disease) who has moved his young son out of the high rise sterility of life into what appears to be the perfectly little safe, gated, pristine community called WhisperWood. Ian is rarely home: he works for Rhythm as CE of Predictive Analytics, a company that studies buying habits, finding predictions that market to the future needs to create future sales and consumer allegiance. On one of his many redeye airplane trips he is seated by a woman who fears turbulence and asks Ian to talk to her for comfort: Ian shares the newest project - predicting when men will divorce and how they will approach the market out of their divorce situation needs, a conversation that deeply troubles the otherwise silent woman who happens to leave a locket behind as she disembarks.When Ian gets off the plane he enters a tram and progresses to his home - noting that everyone knows his name. At home he is greeted by too perfect neighbors and a perfect son and other signs that his home is `strange', sterile, isolated and disconcerting. Longing for his father and for connection he ventures into the woods behind his perfect house, finds a wall and thru through a chink spies a homeless, filthy, fragile man just outside the Valhalla of WhisperWood. How this exposure to a creature who `cannot be accepted to participate in WhisperWood', changes his life is the scurrilous downslide Vande Zande places us on - a door that opens to incredible concepts and changes that will stun the reader.Having said it before in reviews of his other books, this reader maintains that again Jeff Vande Zande's place among the great writers of today - and yesterday - is secured. Having written poetry before he turned to fiction he seems to be coming to grips with his past and is assuring us of his future. This is a book that will restore confidence in the quality of writing possible in this era of staccato transient online communication. Luxuriate.

After flirting online for some time, Manuel finally decides to take a chance and meet Julio, who has been suspiciously firm about not sharing photos or personal information.  The chemistry is there from the start, and Manuel gradually opens up to Julio, explaining about a previous relationship that did not end well, leaving some emotional scars.  Julio pledges complete honesty and shares Manuel's distaste for guys who try to manipulate others into sex.  It becomes clear that Manuel's suspicions are not completely satisfied, especially when Julio becomes somewhat aggressive when Manuel tries to take things slow.The low budget is obvious in the limited cast and direction, which takes place mostly in Manuel's apartment, while the plot is developed through his repetitive flashbacks to earlier events.  The actors are attractive and capable, but have little to challenge them (or engage viewers) except for the final 15 minutes or so of this somewhat short (80 minute) film.  The direction in which the director takes the film is somewhat creative and unexpected. In Spanish with English subtitles, this would have rated an R for nudity (no frontal) and scenes of violence.

The first time I took a class, I found myself slip/sliding all over my standard mat. Next class, I brought a large beach towel and felt like an amateur, not to mention I was still slipping and sliding. I was hesitant to purchase a yoga towel because they were expensive at the studio and the other &#34;yoga brand-names&#34; carried at places like Target had them for high prices that I wasn't quite ready to drop the money for it (HEY! Yoga classes are expensive in itself!). I'm so glad I found this one on Amazon and all the reviewers were right...this is a great towel that is affordable and works perfectly! I got the green one and it's the perfect earthy green color. I use it 4x a week, washing it on Sundays (I wash it with my other workout clothes, on warm/delicate cycle and hang dry). It doesn't hold the sweat odor and after multiple washes, it still looks brand new! It fits perfectly over my yoga mat, with just a little room hanging over the edges so that it grips the floor of the studio, keeping me and my mat in place. It rarely budges during my practice! After class, I flip the edges over so that it nestles in my mat, and roll it up with my standard mat. The thin material keeps it from feeling bulky and the mat and towel fits easily in my yoga carrier. I've gotten multiple compliments on it.

;B00E7HZZ16;[1, 1];4.0;Seth Lynch has created a character in Salazar that is not contemporary, yet feels very 21st century in his relationship with himself and his world. Detective Salazar is independently wealthy, like Peter Whimsey and war wounded like Dorothy Sayers sleuth, but he is edgy like the best of the hard-boiled detectives.He is far more self-aware than the usual loner detective however, so that the periods of self-reflection in between the action scenes are interesting and sometimes entertaining. The mystery is intriguing and the action suspenseful. I couldn't put it down and I can't wait until the next Salazar is published. I need to know what happens next.I discovered this writer on twitter and decided to give the book a try. About once every 6 months I'll try a new author that I find on social media, and I usually regret it almost instantly. Not so in this case. I'm glad that this is Seth Lynch's first novel.

;B00E7KPW5M;[3, 4];5.0;Reading this book has brought me to a new and profound understanding of the Savior.  I (and my wife) have the unique opportunity to be serving as a proselyting missionary couple under the author as the mission president.  His depth of knowledge and understanding on the subject is enhanced by his genuine love and devotion to the Savior.  As I read this book, my understanding and love for my Savior was amplified in so many ways.  I feel that this book has provided me with the raw material I need to truly come to know Him.  The progression of this book opens a new vision of the His Majesty and Power.  As it does, the reader is drawn into the depth of love that He has for each of us.  It has caused me to hunger to know the Savior personally and to live my life for him.  I expect that with subsequent study of this book, I will be able to broaden my understanding and commitment to His work.  This was obviously not written for monetary gain.  The author's love of his fellow man seems to have been the driving force to complete this well written book.

;B00E81X7C0;[1, 1];4.0;"Delicious and romantic side of femdom! Ms. Felthouse shows a more realistic D/s dynamic between a Domme and her sub. In Testing Tom, Katrina's heart is broken as her submissive tosses her over for a ""normal"" relationship. It came out of left field. Now Tom is back and begging for a second chance.This could be a set up for a depraved revenge punishment as well as some harsh grudge f-ing(Amazon censorship word). (Not that there is anything wrong with that scenario because it's just as tempting for me.) Instead, Ms. Felthouse treats the reader to a controlling yet sweet testing of trust rebuilding. There is no set up for failure, instead it's devoted to reassure Katrina isn't setting herself up for another heartbreak.This short story is a good example of a responsible dominant's behaviour accented with steamy kinky scenes. With just a few implements, Katrina dominates easily and it's beautiful to witness. The BDSM is realistic except for perhaps the ""last"" test. The last test is absolutely fabulous, one of my FAVOURITE fetishes. Not sure about the rules in UK, but in US, this wouldn't be allowed even in a private club unless it was a closed private party. Still, it's a fitting ending.Ms. Felthouse's writing voice is smooth and infused with well placed humour. This short story is recommended to kinky romance readers looking for a good femdom piece.*I received this book as a review copy in return for an honest reviewNote: My rating is as follows:5 star - I really loved it4 star - I really liked it3 star - I liked and enjoyed it2 star - It was okay1 star - I didn't like it";08 1, 2013;A1EOPVY8GQCN1C;La Crimson Femme;Delicious and romantic side of femdom;1375315200

Thought I'd try the poor man's wireless setup and avoid going thru a mixer/preamp. Boy was I wrong with this one!

Small but VERY noticeable static scratches for &lt;= 1 second every 2 minutes+/- for the remainder of a 70 minute talk. At first it was almost undetectable while monitoring but after burning the CD it became very obvious. Enough so that I could not use the master I recorded from the ULM100USB. Luckily I had a digital recorder tied to the mic stand as a backup!I sent 2 sample clips of the noise to Behringer Customer Care along with a detailed account of how it was being used. Their answer, ""I've listened to both audio files and heard the static you mentioned previously.  This sounds kind of like general interference coming through."" General interference??? So I should expect and accept ""General Interference"" from their product?The static has increased to every hard consonant gets a scratch. And Behringer Customer Care has stopped responding to my email requests for a warrantee return!

;B00EADORMA;[6, 7];3.0;"These monsters were possibly from another dimension? Well, the ending came from the realm of the really, really bad too.But first, the Good: Napier is an excellent writer. Character development was excellent. You really cared what happened to our two main characters. The creatures - or monsters - were interesting and mysterious as well.  It certainly kept my attention.Now, the Bad: First, this story is bleak. I mean really bleak. If you like stories like &#34;The Road,&#34; this one's for you.Second, there is just too much mystery. Yes, mystery is good, but by the end of the book, I want at least a few of my questions answered. That  just didn't happen here. Maybe the main characters have to suffer with all the mystery in their lives, but the readers shouldn't have to. You never find out: Where did the creatures really come from? What did they want on Earth?  Were their intentions good or bad? What were the nests?  How do people see what they want to in them? What does the darkness in the nests represent? What killed all the people in the world, even in the small towns? Other people? Bombs? Monsters? Nests?I expected I'd get answers to at least some of these questions by the end of the story. How can you name a story &#34;Nests&#34; and not at least provide explanation of what the nests are?  It was a huge let-down to be left in the dark about every big question in this book.  And there was even a perfect avenue to provide the answers - access by the main characters to military computer.The last sentence of the book suggests that the darkness/light puzzle of the book (ie, move towards the light and away from the darkness) has an esoteric or even religious meaning that the rest of the book was completely bereft of.  There was no religious connotations at all, so I wondered at the end: Where did that idea come from? The answer (yes, I actually give answers in this review): It was totally out of the blue and seemed to have nothing whatsoever to do with the rest of the book.Finally, the ending of this book was abysmal. It actually made me feel angry with the author, like when the main character wakes up and discovers he has been dreaming and you want to strangle the author for putting you through an entire story that was really just a dream. No, this story wasn't just a dream, but that might have even been preferable to this ending.To have such a well written book end this badly and with not a single question answered was a huge disappointment.";01 2, 2014;A3S4YJA0YS45P5;Ellen Levy;The Ending Was Beyond Bad;1388620800

;B00EANAG84;[0, 0];4.0;"3.5 Stars~Reviewed by SUZANNE & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogLaura Sanders is finding life post divorce rather anti climatic, the divorce was supposed to be the hard part not life afterwards. Still stuck in ruts she created whilst she was married Laura is determined to rediscover her fun side and start enjoying herself. When she meets Bryan Sinclair, her best friend in high school, her fun starts to heat up, but can Laura risk her heart again and begin a new relationship when she has struggled so hard to get over her last one?I really enjoy this series, it is a great mixture of sexy romance and a tale of giving yourself a second chance after life has battered you about. At this point in the series we are reading about Laura who&#8217;s life after divorce wasn&#8217;t quite as liberating as she expected, it was a great ride watching Laura, reluctantly sometimes, throw off the shackles and expectations others have placed on her and start to enjoy herself.A lot of this enjoyment did come from a very sexy old friend Bryan who not only challenged her in the bedroom but encouraged her to start having fun. They were a great couple, they had sexual chemistry from the  moment they were reunited and for those of you who enjoy a little domination in your men than Bryan will definitely tickle your fancy.Once again Mari Carr has delivered a well written and sexy story, which may not have been my favourite in the series but that didn&#8217;t stop me from devouring every page and eagerly waiting for the next book.* ARC provided by publisher";01 1, 2014;A1JKGTL51HHTU1;Under The Covers Book Blog;I really enjoy this series,;1388534400

I now have a MFC-6490 CW printer that I have had for about 6 years.  I am looking at the MFCJ6920, because I have never been happy with print quality of my printer.  Yes it handles paper well, but in my opinion, the prime reason you buy a printer is for PRINTING.  If it does that poorly then the rest is of not much value.  I was hoping that this one had those problems solved.  Sadly it sounds like they are not.  How can Brother ignore this problem for this long?????;06 13, 2014;A11Z6ZJ68JTSEM;Frank I.

;B00EERCZ7Q;[0, 0];4.0;"I am relatively new to metal and all it's nuances and history, having only started to pay attention to this genre within the last 2 or 3 years.  I'm still trying to figure out what I like and what I don't like.  I only discovered Amorphis around December 2011 while ""boning up"" on the bands that were going to be on the 2012 70000 Tons of Metal Cruise, and I can tell you from the first track I heard that this was a band I definitely liked.This band is one of the reasons I can never quit Spotify for very long: I will inevitably decide it is time to listen to Amorphis and then remember ""oh right, I don't actually own any of their stuff,"" because with their extensive back catalog of quality albums, I couldn't justify buying them all in one shot, nor could I decide which one to start with, so I just listened on Spotify (likewise: Tristania and In Extremo, two more bands I picked up on the cruise).I did notice this album seemed to be light on tracks where the harsher vocals were more prominent, which is a shame.  The earlier works from this band, along with those of the folk metal band Eluveitie,  helped me to start developing an appreciation for melodic growly vocal lines, where before all my ear could hear was a guy who needed a cough drop. So, it was a slight disappointment to not have those songs represented on the album.That said, this album is still one of those where every next track makes me say ""no wait, *this* is my favorite!"" and crank the volume until the speakers in my car are crackling and I have to tap it down a bit because it no longer sounds good.  I am tickled to have spent only $4.99 to pick up a collection of 15 awesome Amorphis tunes.  (tickled, there goes what little metal cred I had...)For reference, other Amorphis compilations include:Story: 10th Anniversary (released 2000)Chapters(released 2003)Forging The Land Of Thousand Lakes(originally a cd/dvd, released July 2010)andMagic And Mayhem - Tales From The Early Years(rerecording of earlier works, released Sept 2010)";10 7, 2013;ACU7LCEIGWPS6;Kimberly M.

;B00EHDXYIG;[3, 3];5.0;This was a fantastic--in every way-- of my most beloved of operas.  I bought the version on vinyl with Karl Boehm nearly 50 years ago, and still play it at times.  The staging and costumes were spectacular in the Bregenz production, and the setting on the lake greatly enhanced the mood of the opera.  Some Mozart purists might be offended by this interpretation, and I guess they can just close  their eyes and listen to the orchestra and singers because the music is good.  Mozart seemed to enjoy a bit of quirkiness, and he  might have been pleased with this performance.  The filming in Blu-ray is beautiful, and for $30 or so, much less expensive than a ticket to see the opera and arrange flights and a hotel.  When more people learn of this version, I should think it would not be easy to keep it in stock.;03 4, 2014;AKWV4ZRH4VA67;George E. Carl;Mozart would have been amused;1393891200

Tea Beyond Teapot Harmony with Tea Warmer Cozy;B00EIKPB0M;[1, 1];5.0;"I received the Harmony teapot and warmer cozy last week.  I have other teapots from Tea Beyond and love the no drip spout and the designs.  This pot is a more sturdy glass than some of the smaller pots.  It comfortably holds 4 -8 oz cups of tea.  I like the stainless steel infuser as opposed to the glass because tea sometimes clogs up in the glass...in this one the tea moves through freely.  The stainless steel top pops firmly into the infuser and the infuser fits equally as firmly into the pot.  This can be a little bit tricky when brewing loose leaf tea as both top and infuser are very hot from the tea; also you must use the infuser with the lid, it does not fit into the pot on it's own.  So I used a towel to remove the components, emptied out the tea and put lid/infuser back into the pot. You can then easily pour the tea without holding onto the lid.  The warmer cozy is great...it keeps that entire pot of tea hot...I mean it keeps it HOT...probably also due to the stainless steel infuser.  You can also use the cozy with any other heat resistant teapot which is a bonus. This pot can also go into the refrigerator.  I use it to make 4 cups of herbal tea in the morning and then drink some hot and refrigerate the rest.  I love the sleek design and it is easy to handle.";09 16, 2013;A2KOQXSJRQD22M;CarolAnn;love the sleek design and warmer cozy;1379289600

The black colored mitt may be intimidating at first, but when you touch the material, it's super soft. It's amazing how rubbing this mitt on your skin removes thin layers of dead skin which you can actually see crumbling away. It almost looks like wet gray newspaper pieces if that even makes sense.  It left my skin feeling really silky which was surprising; I thought it was going to feel more raw after seeing all the dirt come off.  The one thing that can be annoying is that you have to prep your skin by sitting under the shower for 5 minutes and then step away from the water before you start scrubbing, but it's definitely worth the time if you're looking for a relatively inexpensive scrub that'll make you feel unbelievably clean.";09 9, 2013;A3VIG9BXI8MBOF;Lucy L.;My experience with dermasuri;1378684800

Spiegen LG G2 case was exactly what we were looking for! Softer black rubber (but not gummy like silicon or TPU!) with plastic outer shell with a splash of vibrant color!

Glossy plastic leaves smudges, but looks much better than flat color and I am a huge fan of flat colors. Nothing periodic cleaning with a baby wipe can't cure.

I had the original G previously with the Diztronic case and was very happy with the fit and feel.  This case LOOKS great.  The hard plastic piece feels good, but doesn't wrap around the entire side.  It honestly seems to be unnecessary and only for the looks.  The discomfort comes from a rim of hard, glossy rubber that runs around the front of the case.  Where it joins the back, softer rubber, it forms a sharp edge all the way around the case.  It is especially uncomfortable around the bottom of the phone where it rests on my pinky finger as I view the screen.  The other area that is minor, but actually affected me more that I thought it might.  There's a notch out of the upper right corner of the case.  The phone fell on that corner and it did scuff it.  If it hit hard enough on this corner, I could see it damaging the phone.  Not sure if there's a reason for the notch in the case, but it doesn't seem to have  purpose.;04 26, 2014;A1ZAVHX3NQYOI;Jason King;Uncomfortable to hold;1398470400

I was so confidant in this product from reading the product reviews that I did not get insurance on my new phone.  This case barely fit my phone and was made out of cheap plastic. Well, the 5th day I had my new phone in this case my phone fell out of my purse hitting the ground.  The screen shattered into little shards of glass.  I was not able to use the screen to even answer the phone.  I had to pay $190.00 to get the screen fixed.  Don't waste your money on this case.

"Casio Men's PRG-270-1 &quot;Protrek&quot; Triple Sensor Multi-Function Digital Sport Watch";B00ENCRBO4;[0, 0];5.0;"There have been some well thought out and thorough reviews here already. I really can't add much to them from a technical standpoint, so instead i'll mention some personal thoughts about this watch. If you're torn between this model and the PRW3000 (as i was) maybe this will be of particular interest to you.-This is my first ABC watch. I've always wanted one but never badly enough to pay hundreds (plural) of dollars for one that wasn't a model from 6 years ago.They finally made one that's priced affordably. (and it's got top of the line sensors!)-Looks-wise: Well, it's a big watch. but YOU WANT THAT. Manipulating a small faced watch with smaller buttons while wearing gloves or in the rain and mud isn't so great. I like the way this watch looks, but that's probably because it looks like you're wearing the entire Millennium Falcon on your wrist. It's not something you want to even attempt to wear in any kind of semi-formal setting. Contrast that with the prw3000, which is very sleek, and a lot of people have said that they wear it both to work and outdoors. But that's not what i'm after. (and maybe neither are you.) I want an outdoors watch. I have more than enough watches to wear to work. (and since I know where everything is at work, the temperature is controlled by a box on the wall, and it almost never rains inside of the building... I don't need an altimeter/barometer/compass/thermometer watch there.)-Positive display: I dislike negative displays. In my opinion they serve no function beyond ""looking cool"" in studio flash photography. I'm not saying that's bad. Watches have always been aesthetic objects. I'm just saying that a multifunction outdoors watch should be, well... functional. (that means being able to read it in low light or bright sun glare at a glance)-The strap is very comfortable, and the entire watch is very light for its size. You probably won't believe this but i've forgotten it was on my wrist more than a few times already.-I like the bezel ring with the compass markings on it. The prw3000 doesn't have these, and I'm all for them since they serve a function that's actually relevant and useful to the watches other fucntions (Thank you, Casio for not putting a virtually useless tachymeter ring on the bezel. really.)-The prw3000 has atomic timekeeping. I won't lie, that would be really cool if it were on this watch. But not ""$100 more"" cool.Anyway that's it. For the price you really aren't going to go wrong here.";03 13, 2014;A5M66LL05XR3K;Some Guy;A steal at this price.;1394668800

Previous to this set, my drill was an old Makita that I made my living with back when I did construction. Lives change but my Makita has been there all along. It no longer holds much charge but I will still bring it out when something needed a quick fix. After receiving the Bosch drills, I have to say, ""My, my, things have improved.""Pros:*  Super quick charge that lasts for hundreds of screws.*  Very light weight and small so it's easy to get into cramped spaces.*  Positive locking chuck that is incredibly easy to engage with just a twist of your wrist. This part actually took me awhile to realize as I was used to my old one that required engaging the drill. The Bosch can be tightened with just hand pressure. This is really nice.*  Built in spot to hold a spare bit on the handle. If you're doing a project which requires constantly changing between two bits these quick change and holder will speed things up greatly.*  Built in light that actually works and helps light up your workspace.Cons:*  I don't care for the carrying case. The more heavy duty version of the Boschs drills comes with a more compact and logically laid out case. This does not affect the performance at all but I consider it a minor negative for the overall package.Final Verdict:For work around the house or minor construction jobs, these are an excellent product. I would not hesitate to recommend them.";11 13, 2013;AFDJGY68CQL2X;"Snail Dealer ""Snail""";Blows away my 15 year old Makita;1384300800

;B00ERDGMT4;[12, 13];5.0;"The original Borderlands was a good, if flawed, game that combined full on first person shooter action with RPG elements.  While Fallout III (another first person RPG) focused more on the RPG aspect (the VATS mode, where combat is temporarily taken out of the arena of reflexes, and instead depends entirely on stats, was ample evidence that Bethesda knew the limits of the game's FPS mechanics), Borderlands put twitchy action first, with the RPG elements there to essentially keep the player engaged beyond the mechanics.  As unique as the game's cel-shaded look, pick up and play online co-op questing, and overall quirky feel were, the game did suffer from a few flaws.  Namely, the game's characters and storyline progression were muddled and sort of buried, Pandora's desolate environments tended to blend together, and extended play sessions could become extremely tedious.  The promise was definitely there, but the execution was just a bit short of the game's ambitions.Borderlands 2, fortunately, delivers on that promise extensively.  This review is for the Game of the Year Edition, which takes the already impressive &#34;vanilla&#34; Borderlands 2 game, and packages it with a second disc to install the 4 major downloadable campaigns, 2 additional characters, and a couple odds and ends.  That's right; Gearbox wisely learned that we don't want that voucher @#$#@$!, and want something that will work if we fire up the old Xbox 360/PS3 a decade later, after the servers no longer have that DLC up.  So a word of warning- make sure you have enough hard drive space (probably at least 7-8 gigs).  Unfortunately, the GOTY Edition does not include the &#34;Headhunter&#34; mini-expansions that just came out, nor does it include the latest level cap increase.  That being said, this edition of the game has a lot of gameplay packed in there.  On my single playthrough as a Gunzerker, I've clocked around 95 hours after completing all the campaigns, and most, but not all, of the sidequests.While the original Borderlands essentially threw you onto an alien planet with the vague goal of &#34;find and open the hidden alien vault&#34;, Borderlands 2 has a much more out-front story, involving a corporate villain named Handsome Jack, who has somehow taken credit for the original Vault Hunters' deeds from the first game.  The game begins with him double-crossing a new team of Vault Hunters, thus setting the conflict up from the get-go.  During the course of the game, you run into the now-discredited old Vault Hunters, who are trying to fight the tyranny of Jack (who has essentially declared his intent to rule Pandora), as well as other characters old (Scooter, Tannis, Marcus) and new (Tiny Tina, and a host of other NPCs).  The humor is much more pronounced, which can be both a good thing and a bad thing.  Fighting &#34;shirtless men&#34; volleyball players at a bandit airbase in an obvious reference to Top Gun is pretty entertaining, as are the violent verbal outbursts of Randy Savage-wannabe Mr. Torgue, but by the same token, the constant sardonic, pop-culture/internet meme savvy, relentlessly self-aware, almost hipsterish &#34;Really? Seriously?&#34; tone is bound to annoy at some point.  The game's unmistakeably prominent personality is a double-edged sword, but it does certainly keep it from being another grim po-faced military shooter.It's much harder to find fault with the rest of the game, though.  Borderlands 2 manages to be modern and old-school at the same time.  The character ability progression, constant allure of finding new cool weapons, vehicular combat, and slick controls all fit in perfectly with current gaming, as do the vast, open environments.  By the same token, however, you'll find the kind of elaborate area layouts (complete with dead ends, and all manner of nooks and crannies) you'd find back in the days of Doom II, as opposed to the linear, simplified level design many shooters use currently.  On a similar note, when many shooters seem content to have a limited selection of enemies, Borderlands 2 is bursting with variety, and even more so in the GOTY Edition.  Mutated madmen, enraged nomads, corporate soldiers, armed bandits in jeeps and hover-gunships, robot walkers, flying drones, transforming fliers, killer arachnids, multi-armed giant primates, burrowing underground monsters, wolf-beasts, crystalline hulks, chameleon-like deadly lizards, monstrous flying insects, pirates, ghosts, biker gangs, unbalanced corporate goons, titanic insectoid walkers, deadly flying spoors, alien scorpions, savage cultists..........oh, and orcs, skeletons, dragons, knights, wizards, and dwarves.  I've managed to miss more than a few enemy types in my list, so as you can tell, there's a lot of variety.  The environments also have more variety this time around, even if there's some blatant resource recycling.  Icy wastelands, temperate highlands, deserts, irradiated volcanic fields, frontier towns, swamps, and even some more developed areas await you.  Places like Hayter's Folly (an oasis hidden in a cave system), the vast scale of the Caustic Caverns, which only appear after a major story event, and &#34;The Beatdown&#34;, a Detroit-like urban area taken over by psychotic gangs, are just a couple of many well-designed environments.  Like many western RPGs, to get the full experience of the game, you need to tackle side quests constantly, as they not only provide experience points, they also expose you to characters and areas outside the main questline.  Oh, and they are often quite amusing.The expansions are all surprisingly meaty, and together provide a huge amount of bang for the buck (enough to easily make it worth the purchase even if you have the non-GOTY version).  What's more impressive is the fact that the core game itself never felt compromised in favor of cutting content for it to only be resold later as DLC.  The expansions all feel connected as part of the whole experience, but are still separate enough to avoid feeling like just cut content.  All 4 expansions are high quality, but the last one, &#34;Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep&#34; is particularly noteworthy, as it takes the game in a fairly different direction, turning the game into a loving parody of the fantasy genre, set in a set of fantasy-themed zones that you can still jump back and forth from with the rest of the game areas.If there's a weakness, aside from the occasionally overbearing &#34;this is teh LOLZ!!!!&#34; humor, it's that, as before, extended play sessions can become tedious after a while.  While this game has definitely improved on keeping the environments from blending together as much as the first game's did, Pandora is still a relatively desolate place, and the game's heavy reliance on, well, shooting stuff can make it hard to play more than a few hours in a row.  But this is something that most games with a lot of content unavoidably suffer from, and it's nothing that taking a day off in between sessions won't easily fix.  All things considered, this game is one of the better ones to emerge from its generation.  For people who never played the base version of Borderlands 2, and for those who did, but didn't bother with the DLC, this one is a no brainer.";12 26, 2013;A19L4J82QJPY7B;J.

ViaJet Travel Rechargeable Oral Irrigator;B00ET9SOMO;[0, 0];5.0;I was first familiar with this irrigator from its Panasonic incarnation in Europe. That version is nearly twice the price, comes (annoyingly) with one tip rather than two as here. The charger on it is a heavier unit that charges faster. This unit's charger is light, small, but charges more slowly.The winner in my opinion, is THIS one, no question.It is powerful, the charge lasts a long time, it is a clever travel-friendly design that is just as suitable for permanent home use, and modestly priced.I should say that I don't think any of these portable irrigators last a long time, but that seems to be the nature of the beast. Maybe this unit will prove me wrong on that. But in any event this certainly beats on all counts the other major contender, sold under ToiletTree and other names.An issue with the first unit I ordered was handled professionally by OraTec.;07 5, 2014;AO4LJ777HXG8A;"Tom Suarez ""Cattigara""";Excellent, from a portable irrigator veteran;1404518400

I have to qualify that statement though as I do store it in my purse so it could be from items rubbing on it.  Although, I'm very careful with my devices.

Boone is a giant from collosus he is trying to save his sister so he kidnapped K so she would take h to the mines where his sister was being used as labor. In capturing K her paladin suit was damaged so they took it off of her. After they took the suit off of her she became dependent on Boone's touch. From their is where the journey to discovery begins. Will K and Boone have a happy ending? Will she find out who she  and what she really is? Will she be safe from the bad people who kidnapped her as a child and made her a paladin warrior?

;B00EUBGMB6;[5, 5];3.0;I loved most of EA's kindred books and this is something along that scheme, but also different. I liked K and Boone, they were really sweet and in the beginning half of the book, I laughed at the funny things that happened and I worried about all the difficulties and issue they would face. Slowly and steadily though, the book progresses through space and it seemed as if everyone was the villain and these two could just not get a break. The story became a little drawn out and lecture-y with all the pondering about cycles and suits for emotional damping etc. and this went on for too long. This book was not as hot as the others that EA writes but in its own way has that sense-of-the-forbidden thrill about it. All in all, a good book and I am always going to read EA's books but this one may not go onto my re-read shelf as other from EA have.;08 30, 2013;A179ZGXWA4RW3Q;"starsaga ""starsaga""";3.5 stars, original sci-fi but slightly overdone.;1377820800

;B00EW6QT76;[12, 26];3.0;"I'm updating to let u know mine froze up a little tonight be warned and wait till they fix the glitch.  But when it worked it looked and felt great.  The next generation of gaming is finally upon us: The PlayStation 4, Sony's first new gaming console since 2006, is now available. And this is the console that PlayStation I have been waiting for. With stunning visuals and a cleaner user interface, the PS4 is a significant step up from the PlayStation 3--for gaming. As for entertainment, it doesn't give you much more than the previous-generation PS3 offers.Because consoles evolve over time, it's hard to fully assess the new PlayStation this early in the game--but there are plenty of exciting features I can talk about now. After several days of testing, here are our my impressions.What's in the box?For $400, you get the PlayStation 4 console (of course), and a power cord, an HDMI cable, the DualShock 4 controller and charging cable, and an earbud/microphone for chat. You also get a 30-day trial of PlayStation Plus and Music Unlimited, $10 to spend in the PlayStation Store, a quick-start guide, and a safety guide.SetupSetting up the PS4 is a fairly simple procedure: Plug in the power cord, plug in the HDMI cable, and power on. You're then walked through connecting your controller and connecting to the Internet, setting up your PlayStation Network account, and syncing your account with social-media services if you choose. You have the option to set up the PlayStation Camera if you've bought one, but it doesn't come with the console. Then you're ready to start playing.How it worksThe back of the PS4 console has connections for HDMI, Ethernet, USB, and optical audio. On the front are two additional USB ports, along with the Blu-ray disc-loading slot and two buttons, Power and Eject, which are almost hidden--they're small and narrow, and the labeling is even smaller.A strip in the middle of the console lights up to indicate the PS4's status: It turns orange in standby mode, blue to indicate the system is powering up, and white when the system is on. It took between 22 and 24 seconds for the console to boot up, regardless of whether it was turned off or in standby mode--only slightly faster than the most recent version of the PlayStation 3.ControllerThe DualShock 4 controller, including the new thumbsticks and triggers, feels more comfortable to use than the previous-generation DualShock 3. It features an LED bar that lights up on the back to indicate different things. When charging, for example, the light is orange. The controller also has motion sensitivity, dual motors for rumble feedback, a built-in speaker, a headset jack, and a touchpad.The Start and Select buttons have been replaced by the Options button. The share button is also new and lets you share clips of gameplay, screen shots, or a live video feed with friends.The PlayStation 4's Dynamic Menu is much simpler, cleaner, and easier to use than the PS3's Xross Media Bar (XMB) interface. First you choose which account to log into. If you have the PlayStation Camera, you can do this via facial recognition.Upon login, you see a group of tiles that represent apps or games that are available to you. These tiles let you launch a game, launch the Web browser, see which live videos are being broadcast on Twitch and uStream, see what you're currently downloading, or see which games and apps are available in your library.The tiles update to show your most recently used apps or played games first. Scrolling down from any of these tiles gives you more information about it. For example, if the tile represents a game you've played, you'll see which trophies you've unlocked and new available content. A tile called What's New, which looks similar to Facebook's timeline, shows you your friends' recent activities and provides information on new and upcoming games.Navigate up from these tiles to see a simple row of icons that allow you to access the PlayStation Store, check notifications, check your Friend's List, send messages, set up or join parties, check your trophies and compare them to your friends', edit your profile, and access system settings. Once you've started another application or game, you can press the PS button on the controller to quickly jump back and forth between the menu and that application.All this works intuitively. If you have a lot of apps installed, though, the bar of apps could grow to be a bit unwieldy.VisualsThe PS4 is capable of an impressive level of detail. In the game KillZone Shadow Fall, for example, the amount of detail you can detect in subtle features such as skin texture and facial stubble, along with new lighting effects, make for very lifelike images. Not every game will take advantage of this, but the PS4 is capable of significantly better visuals than its predecessor.OnlineOnline gameplay works largely the same way as on the PS3. It took me some time to find online matches to play Assassin's Creed IV--but the console hasn't officially launched yet, so it's a bit early to assess the online gaming environment. Also, your online gaming experience will vary depending on the strength of your network. That said, the provided earpiece and microphone worked well, and I had no trouble communicating with other players.When it comes to making friends on the PlayStation Network (PSN), there are a few options. You can designate someone an Online Friend, which gives you access to his or her profile and screen name. If you want to get to know someone better, or if you know the player outside the gaming world, you can make them a Real Name friend: This lets you see real names and photos.You can also sync your PSN account with your Facebook and Twitter accounts, so you can update and annoy your friends with your gaming accomplishments. The privacy settings can adjust to how much content you want to share (if any).As for entertainment options, the PS4's streaming services include Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Hulu Plus, Redbox Instant, and Vudu. And you have access to Sony's Video and Music Unlimited streaming services; the latter can be used to replace the soundtrack of a game with tunes of your choice.Subscription fees for all of the streaming services apply, but you won't need a PlayStation Plus account ($10 a month, $18 for 3 months, or $50 a year) to access them. Unfortunately, you will need a PlayStation Plus account to play online games on the PS4. (You will also need the Xbox Live gold membership to play online with the coming Xbox One.)Additional accessoriesSome of the most touted features of the PlayStation 4 require accessories that don't come with the console: the PlayStation App, PlayStation Camera, and PlayStation Vita. The PlayStation Camera is probably the chief offender, as it really does seem like it was supposed to be bundled with the console.An app called Playroom, for example, which comes installed on the PS4, requires the Camera to work. If you open the app and don't have the Camera, you end up watching a video about how awesome the Camera is. The Camera is also used for facial recognition and voice commands. These seem like features that were meant to be integrated, not optional.The free PlayStation App, which requires an Android or iOS mobile device, lets you send messages to friends and see what games they've been playing and what trophies they've earned. You can also use the Second Screen option from within the app: The function of this option changes depending on which game you're playing and which second-screen features are available for that game. For example, in The Playroom, you can draw toys on your touch screen and throw them onto the TV screen so you can interact with them. You can also use the app as a remote to navigate the PS4 menu.The PlayStation Vita, Sony's handheld gaming device, is required for Remote Play: This means that you can stream compatible games from your PlayStation 4 to your PlayStation Vita. For best results, you'll need a strong network connection, so don't stray too far from your router. Sony also recommends that you connect the PS4 via Ethernet and make sure both devices are on the same wireless network for the best results.The PlayStation 4's simple interface makes it easy to navigate the menus and find your content. The visuals are impressive and definitely a step up from those of the PlayStation 3. A strong focus on sharing content with friends lends itself to a fun social experience.The PlayStation Plus account, though required for online gaming, is not required for most online features, such as video streaming. You can now navigate the menu and launch some applications while installing games and updates. And you no longer have to wait for a game to be fully downloaded to play it.LowsSome of the PS4's features require additional accessories, which add to the overall cost. Unlike with the PlayStation 3, a PlayStation Plus account is now required for playing games online.A growing trend in the smart-device world is the ability to access and control your set-top box. This is absent from the PS4, especially noticeable as it's present in the Microsoft Xbox One and was even included in the Nintendo Wii U; still, some may not find it to be a deal breaker. You can't use external media other than Blu-ray and DVD playback; so no photos, streaming video, or music playback, at least for now.Bottom lineHere's the big question: Should you buy a PlayStation 4?If you play only casually, you won't get a lot of entertainment options with the PS4 that aren't available on the PS3 and other cheaper devices.If you're a serious gamer and a fan of the PS4's exclusive games, though, then the answer is a resounding yes. The killer app for the PS4 might be Remote Play, so if you own a PlayStation Vita or are planning to get one for the holidays, that's also a good reason to jump on the PS4.SpecificationsPlayStation4Main processorSingle-chip custom processorCPU: low power x86-64 AMD ""Jaguar"", 8 coresGPU: 1.84 TFLOPS, AMD Radeon(tm) Graphics Core Next engineMemory GDDR5 8GBHard Disk Drive Built-inOptical Drive (Read only)BD 6xCAVDVD 8xCAVI/O Super-Speed USB (USB 3.0), AUXCommunicationEthernet (10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T)IEEE 802.11 b/g/nBluetooth 2.1 (EDR)AV outputHDMIDigital Output (optical)The PlayStation 4's beautiful graphics, blazing interface, and near-perfect controller make it a worthy successor to the PS3, but it would be wise to wait for more titles and features before you buy.

Loved the idea of a black chrome controller. The good of it is that it came with all the required tools to disassemble the controller that's about all. The bad the shell felt flimsy and cheap,the buttons had a lot of play in them, the control sticks wouldn't work with the new case. Also this case destroyed the range of my Xbox controller. I was limited to about six feet with no obstructions. If anything got in the way or outside the range the controller would disconnect, Finally with in three months the chrome on all wearing surfaces started to rub off or crack. I was left with a horrible looking controller with next to no range that felt extremely cheap. I would avoid buying this product. If I were you I would say just get the tool kit for dis-assembly and some cans of spray paint and do it the old school way that is what i ended up doing.;07 5, 2014;A1B4QTL8VGPJUL;Michael Allen Jarocha;Never again.;1404518400

Sleep Innovations 14-Inch Memory Foam Mattress, King;B00EZ5TC4G;[25, 29];5.0;"Sleeping is such a personal thing that most people recommend that you at least try the mattress out before you buy it.  Obviously that is not possible with amazon so I will do my best to provide as much detail as I can in this review.This is a quality firm mattress.  It may be that we have a water-proof cover on the thing (we share our mattress with a pug) but after a couple nights' sleeping on it, the mattress has not ""softened up"" as much as several websites say it will once it absorbs your body heat.  Instead, it stayed quite firm, though perhaps not quite as firm as it was when we first lay down on it.  The result is that while it is very comfortable when I am sleeping on my side, it is somewhat less comfortable when I am on my back.  It is however, less springy than our old spring mattress.  We have not tried to see if a glass of champagne will stay filled while we bounce up and down (as they do in some hocky commercial) but I do not wake up when my husband gets up in the night.  I sleep fairly deeply but I used to at least be aware of him getting up; not anymore.  Due to its firmness, if you are expecting the mattress to sort of ""cradle you"" you may be in for a disappointment.  If, however, you are looking for a nice firm mattress that supports you, this is definitely worth considering.  Another plus is that the edges of the bed feel the same as the rest of it.  A definite plus if you are always getting pushed to the edge.  I do and this has definitely helped me.Sleep innovations boasts that it stays cool.  It does.  However, that may be associated with its firmness too.  Also, as a result of the coolness you may want to consider warmer bedding in wintertime.  We opted for flannel sheets, especially now that it's getting cold.The mattress comes in a vacuum-sealed plastic bag that is somehow stuffed into a box that seems impossibly small.  Perhaps as a result, it needs a bit of time to breathe and release the factory smells.  If you look online this process is called ""offgassing"".  I would recommend you let it sit for at least 72 hours before using it and not to let is ""offgas"" in the bedroom where you plan to sleep.  We put it in my husband's studio for a little over 72 hours and then carried it into the bedroom.  This prevented the odor from permeating the bedroom or, indeed, the house.  So if you have that option, I would definitely recommend it.  But then, I am fairly sensitive to smells.Another plus is that this mattress feels like it should be easier to move than our old one.  We carried it across the back yard and (even though it weighs about 100 pounds) it seemed more doable than our old one.  We will hopefully not move from our home for quite a while but this may make a difference to folks who need to move frequently.As we slept on this mattress for only a short while, I will update this review after we have slept on it for one month.The bottom line for me though, is this.  I sprained my ankle back in March and ever since it has hurt a bit when I get up in the morning. With this mattress, that pain has lessened.UPDATE: We have been sleeping on this mattress for almost a month now and it has definitely softened and while it is still firm it is not nearly as firm as it was.  I prefer that.  In addition, it is a lot warmer--and I like that too.  Will keep you posted.So, all in all, this is a very good firm memory foam mattress, especially for the price.  If you like a firm night's sleep and like to sleep on your side, I definitely recommend it.";10 30, 2013;A16ALXKQ02SKYG;"Inna Tysoe ""Inna Tysoe""";Quality Firm Mattress;1383091200

"CTM&reg; Unisex Leather Double Glasses Holder Case";B00EZ7LK9O;[1, 1];5.0;"I'm surprised at how few of choices are offered for a case of this type.  I wanted a case that would secure to my belt that could hold my Nexus 5 phone, my reading glasses and other small items while I roller skate.  This item is about perfect.  Most bags/pouchs were either too big (fanny packs) or too small to fit my glasses.The quality is nice. There are two straps on the back that any width belt would fit.  My 5 inch screen phone fits with no problem.  I am uncertain if something as big as a Galaxy Note would fit. I doubt that it would.  My standard fold wallet fits, just barely, as it is somewhat difficult to zip up with the wallet in it. The two main ""glasses"" compartments have padding in between that should protect items from damaging each other.  The outer zippered compartment on the outside front is not padded between it and the ""glasses"" compartment.  For me, this is fine.  Too, much padding and you end up with something that is too big.  Overall, I like it.If I had one complaint: I wish it were more stylish.  I really liked the looks of this itemNew Mens Leather Pocket Waist Packs Bag Wallet Purse Pouch Handbag for Samsung Galaxy Note /Galaxy S /Iphone 4,5 / 6852a, for twice the price, and would have ordered it too, it not for taking so long for shipment.

;B00EZVKE3S;[2, 2];5.0;Gray-Nomad knows how to drive points home. Tell the audience a story, ask questions about that story and see if they learned the lessons it contained. That is how this book on HIGH FUNCTIONING ALCOHOLICS begins - a short story in which a woman pays a hospital visit, observes all manner of people - those in the hospital for varying degrees of alcoholism and its physical impacts, the staff, the people around her - unpacks her rum and cokes her husband has provided for her to drink during her stay, and finally returns home to a husband who offers her a drink. The story is much more complex than this but in outline form it shares the gist of the author's message: there are low profile alcoholics who are obvious, but there are high functioning alcoholics who manage to drink daily in large amounts and still carry on a work life and social life as though they had not a drop of the disabling drug in their system. Or as the author phrases it, `High-functioning alcoholics generally lead respectable and often high-profile lives, and just like non-alcoholics they are usually as successful in maintaining home, family, job and friends.'From this introduction the author take us through the diagnosis of just what a HFA is, the ways to self evaluate your alcohol intake to see if you may possibly fall into this category, the systems certain groups have initiated to assist people in not drinking to much, and steps individuals can take to determine if they have a drinking problem. `Many well-known people have publicly acknowledged their battles with alcohol and entered recovery before their lives were destroyed. Betty Ford, the astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the actors Elizabeth Taylor, Mary Tyler Moore and Robin Williams, the singers Keith Urban and Eric Clapton, the football legend Joe Namath and former US President George Bush' - giving examples helps the reader focus on the extent of the problem. `Research shows half of all alcoholics are high-functioning types. The abuse can go on for decades until and unless some alcohol-related crisis occurs, like being arrested for drunken driving, exposed forhaving made unwanted sexual advances or a relationship breakdown.'The author drives the message home solidly by referring to personal management of alcohol intake, telling us how to determine when the line has been crossed between social drinking and high functioning alcoholic. So much data is presented that the book stands as a medical reference for the control of alcoholism. And using HFA Orson Welles' hoax radio show as a pivot, the entire impact of hoaxes on our thinking is discussed. `The short stories are there to show how high functioning alcoholism is near invisible to those unaware of the full lifestyle of the person affected.'This is a very important little book that deserves wide distribution, especially in the media and in classrooms.

;B00F0CLD5E;[0, 0];5.0;"David Kusumoto's stellar review inspired me to write a review of this as well once I received and viewed the film.  I viewed it and loved it!This film got some warm-up showings at Austin Texas' annual South by Southwest (SXSW) in March of 2013.  It was met with rave reviews and from there was shown nationwide at the annual Fests for Beatles Fans.Like the Scorcese documentaryLiving In The Material Worldand the Cirque du Soleil's ""Love"" tribute to the Beatles, the two surviving  Beatles and their spouses as well as their bandmates' widows were approached and ""Good Ol' Freda"" got the nod from all directly involved.  Ryan White who directed this stellar work did his homework and did it well.  Nobody can argue with the high level of research that went into making this film.What distinguishes this film from the myriad of films about the Beatles including documentaries is that it is not the cliche expos&eacute; that so many purporting to be documentaries are.  Freda Kelly, the Beatles' secretary has lived privately and quietly and has only just come forward with her observations about her job.  Freda is a very likable and sincere person and when she speaks, she really  has something to say.  Her children and grandson are also in the film and they all were in deep respect for this humble woman who chose not to cash in on the Beatles' name to fame.Viewers get a fresh look at the Beatles as well as enjoying a damn good soundtrack.  Freda shares photos of members of the Beatles' familes that had previously been unpublished.  She was friends with Elsie Gleave Starkey, who viewed her as the daughter she wished she had and the sister she wished her son Ritchie (Ringo) had.  I loved these accounts; one that was especially delightful was when she met the Harrisons and George's father Harry wanted to teach her how to do ballroom dancing.  (Makes you think of their son George singing ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"" in 1964.)  Harry and Louise Harrison taught ballroom dancing for years and in the book ""Living in the Material World,"" there is a picture of Harry and Louise going out dancing.  There is a lovely picture of Harry dancing with Freda in this film.  I had a bit of a giggle at that.  Freda describes Harry and Louise much as George's first wife did - short in stature and delightfully Liverpudlian.  The Harrisons were known to be extremely cordial and appreciative of their fans and made no bones about their appreciation for Freda's work with and for the Beatles.""Good Ol' Freda"" treats viewers to an array of lovely images.  I especially loved the ones of Freda herself, then and currently taking walks by old stomping grounds and landmarks throughout Liverpool.  As an added treat, Tony Barrow, who was the Beatles' press secretary was interviewed along with others who traveled that Long & Winding Road throughout the Beatles' careers.Freda, solid and dependable was not one to act a fool and go wild over the Beatles.  She kept a level head and a professional demeanor and took her job seriously and did it well.  She became the ""go-to"" person where the Beatles were concerned; Pat Kinzer Mancuso even mentions Freda Kelly in her book,Do You Want to Know a Secret?: The Story of the Official George Harrison Fan Club.  Freda was a regular guest in the Beatles' homes; she remained a welcome guest in the houses of Harrison and Starkey for years.George Harrison's sister Louise has said on numerous interviews in recent years (you can catch her on LouTube) that most Britons are humble and not apt to bang on their own drum.  That certainly is true on Freda's case.  She has refused to write a tell all memoir after years of being asked to to so.  Ten years after the Beatles came to America, she parted with her massive Beatles' collection.  Darn shame, really.  The collection alone would have been worth keeping.Freda Kelly has rightfully earned a place of high respect.  She has wisely chosen not to engage in ""Devil's Radio,"" as George Harrison would have said.  George, described by Louise from the time he was a very young boy was one who detested gossip and this was never more true than when he recorded the above mentioned song.  Freda is a Godsend; by NOT downgrading anybody or telling titillating tales out of school, she has set a good tone and good example.  This has reflected well on her and makes her all the more somebody you can respect.  She is a far cry from Francie Schwartz!Freda's own immediate family were not aware of her job and her contacts with the Beatles for many years.  Her daughter Rachel was impressed with what she learned from watching the film as it was, as she said, mostly new and fresh information for her.  Freda has shielded her family from the public eye and her current disclosures have sparked interests, which is natural.  At no time does she compromise her standards.The 1965 John Lennon classic is very a propos in re this film.  ""Some are dead and some are living/in my life, I've loved them all.""  The senior Harrisons, John's Aunt Mimi who raised him; Julia Stanley Lennon and Freddie (""that Alf Lennon"" as the Stanley Sisters called him), Elsie Starkey Graves and Harry Graves, Richard Starkey Sr. and Mary and Jim  McCartney as well as John Lennon and George Harrison are sadly no longer with us.  The Beatles' manager Brian Epstein died in 1967.  The deaths of these key players make the 1965 classic ""In My Life"" all the more poignant and fitting for this film.As for Freda, her willingness to come forward now after nearly half a century has enriched and touched many lives.  That would certainly include those of viewers and hard core inveterate Beatles' fans as well as the Beatles themselves.  Freda is even given a nod on the boys' Christmas albums.  Kudos to Rachel Kelly Norris and her son who, as the newer generations encouraged Freda to reconsider coming forward and sharing her experiences during the Swinging Sixties, a time of Ford Falcons and wonderful music.Ringo  Starr, the Beatle whose mother bonded with Freda thanks her during the credits and Paul McCartney, the other living Beatle supported this film.  Angie McCartney, Paul's stepmother agreed to do a short interview and Paul's younger brother Michael agreed to supply some early photographs for the film as well.In just under an hour and a half, you will go on the Magical Mystery Tour of your life and one you will never forget or regret.  This is a film I cannot recommend highly enough and it is a must have for all Beatles' fans and for all who are interested in the Beatles.  Freda is a vital key player and without her help and input, who knows how history would have played out.  Thanks to Freda, we can now give her the kudos she richly deserves.";04 3, 2014;AIEEK7AHXKZCC;BeatleBangs1964;Kudos to Freda!;1396483200

;B00F1CRRIU;[0, 0];5.0;"Let me start by saying Arcade Fire is an incredible band. Definitely one of the best live acts I've seen.There are a million and a half reviews already about this album, good and bad; all I will say is that, as for myself, I absolutely loved this album and have been listening to it almost nonstop since I purchased it. Arcade Fire's music is so powerful that it can have an almost physical effect on you. They could have easily &#34;played it safe&#34; with this album but they are continuing to innovate, tighten their sound, and put out meaningful and valuable music. This was one of those albums that revealed itself to me slowly. The first listen I thought it was &#34;just okay,&#34; but after repeated listens I'm starting to think it might be their best album yet! (Although Funeral will always have a special place in my heart.) Seriously, buy this album if you haven't already. It's a gem.";04 27, 2014;A3P49ISGIDFHXG;Brian Hose;Amazing Album!;1398556800

;B00F1CRRIU;[3, 4];5.0;"If you go into this album expecting anything along the lines of ""The Suburbs"", ""Neon Bible"", or ""Funeral"", you will be very disappointed. With ""Reflektor"", the listener experiences Arcade Fire trying on some new musical styles and execution the likes of which I've certainly never heard before. This album is truly an epic, clocking in at 85 minutes over the span of 2 discs. Each disc has its own personality, and each song serves a purpose. Disc 1 is more danceable and rock-oriented, while Disc 2 is solemn and reflective, sort of like the way ""Remain in Light"" starts out a rocker with the first 5 songs and then slows down with the last 3. Not that I'm comparing ""Reflektor"" to ""Remain in Light"". The two are like night and day.But the bottom line is, Arcade Fire is trying something new here, and to me, it works extremely well. In the end, it may be a tad bit sloppy, but what album isn't? The 2 discs, different as they are from each other, still make up what I consider to be Arcade Fire's best album yet. ""The Suburbs"" and ""Funeral"" will always have a special place in my heart, but ""Reflektor"" is definitely their crowning achievement, so much so that if you're a new listener, you could pick this one up and love AF the same as if you started listening to them back when ""Funeral"" came out. (I'm one of the latter listeners, and I've stuck with AF all the way.) Bands need to evolve and try new things. Arcade Fire is one of today's best bands, and their skill, creativity, and musicianship is well displayed on this album.So don't even bat an eyelash at the other reviews claiming they sound too much like Talking Heads on this effort. They don't. They sound like Arcade Fire, and they will always sound like Arcade Fire.";11 2, 2013;A2M3IJUUNQMKF9;"JP Marone ""SteinDog""";Just lie back, listen, and enjoy;1383350400
;B00F1CRRIU;[3, 4];5.0;Purchased the vinyl from my local record store (thank God they still exist).  It sounds awesome.  Downloaded the MP3's to my iPod and I'm good to go.  Now for my thoughts.  I'm a pretty big fan of the band.  I LOVED the Suburbs record. However I was worried about this record after I heard the producer was the guy from LCD soundsystem.  My fears were exacerbated by the visual of watching Arcade Fire on SNL and Jimmy Kimmel.  Those performances were odd to say the least (what's up with puppets didn't Beck already do that and better by the way).  I guess they are trying to be artistic but it comes off to me at least visually as pretentious.  Now I was ready to hate this record after seeing the band on TV and with knowledge of who produced it.  So I placed the vinyl on the platter dropped the needle and my fears were lifted.  Arcade Fire did it again!!  Another great album from start to finish.  Love the production.  Cool use of tempo changes.  Just a beautiful record.  If you are a fan of the band and are on the fence about getting this album don't.  I'd highly recommend the Vinyl the sound is brilliant.;11 10, 2013;A2TT0F4FKF3J4N;Lars Swanson;Much better then I had feared.  Love this album!;1384041600
;B00F1CRRIU;[2, 5];5.0;It doesn't take a clairvoyant to understand that ''Reflektor'' re-defines indie music and thus, it is destined to generate love and dislike, possibly in equal amounts. Being one of the best bands the current indie scene has to offer, Arcade Fire takes a bold change in their musical direction, steps away from their comfort zone, jettisons all the concerns and potential trepidation associated with keeping up the mainstream success, and introduces a dark art-rock album. The opening track ''Reflektor'' gently warns the listeners that this album is not aiming to repeat the cleaner rock patters of ''Neon Bible'' and ''The Suburbs''. And it only takes three to four songs to realize that the lyrical themes of isolation, alienation, love in unexpected places, resurrection, and disappointment coupled with 80s electro disco sound and synths are not only captivating but they are also bold and refreshing. Songs like ''Here Comes The Night Time'', ''Joan of Arc'', ''Awful Sound'', ''It's Never Over'', and ''Afterlife'' are not only beautiful, but they are intricate, complex, and unpredictable in terms of composition. The whole album creates the feeling that you are possibly stuck in the most dire situation but you are not giving up on life. It is like you are trapped in a dark disco, you are confused but you still have the urge to dance. And just for this reason, ''Reflektor'' is an epitome of how a decent indie album can integrate both craftiness and simplicity into its lyrics and production. Is this album the next ''OK Computer''? Maybe not. Do we care if it is? No. But that's exactly why it is possibly the next best thing.;11 5, 2013;ANZKBHR1MD7JC;Soner;I will probably never understand why a sane indie music buff wouldn't like this album...;1383609600
;B00F1CRRIU;[1, 1];5.0;A good album is one for which my favorite song on it changes as I listen to it repeatedly.

;B00F35AEGW;[1, 2];4.0;"First - I would like to say that the occasional italics in the e-book I read made letters overlap each other and made some sections near impossible to read. For the most part this meant one sentence here, one there, but towards the end there was over a page I had to struggle to read. I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 which I used to read all of this, and I did not notice this issue on the computer.Doubt, Part one of Among Us caught my attention right away when reading the synopsis. I think tossing JJ Abrams' name into the ring to give an idea of the type of story was a good call. One event in the story actually reminded me a little bit of one of the ideas in Fringe, but it was unique to it's own and wasn't a direct similarity.I have to say, that starting the book I expected the main protagonist to remain Harry Doubt, but was surprised at the shift so don't pass this over if a male lead isn't your thing. This change of perspective made for an interesting read. Normally I am a very fast reader averaging about 2.5 pages a minute, and I found myself unable to put this down, absorbing it in a matter of hours. The story never lagged out, making me want to take a break, but instead kept me engrossed wanting more.One thing that annoyed me about the writing style the author chose, was the very informal (Brackets) used to explain some nicknames and abbreviations. It took me out of the experience and reminded me I was reading a book. This happens frequently so it was hard to ignore. Not the worst flaw to have but when some of them were unneeded because I had already been told, it was a bit off putting. Where the explanation was needed, putting the information into a more flowing sentence would have kept me inside the story, and not sitting in a schools attic so to speak ;) Also, sometimes I was also pulled out because of a lack of synonyms, pronouns, or general repetitiveness the phrasing one paragraph would have.All in all, I think this was a great read. The story, while very 'out there' at times, was captivating. The biggest tell for me is that I am actively interested in reading the next two books in the series. I feel like there was just enough detail given in this part of the Doubt tale to make it hold it's own, but plenty left to make you really want to know both the answers to questions/issues presented and wonder what else there is that you can't even think of.";09 29, 2013;A2PPZDJVWLATNG;Justdej;Just like a trilogy should be;1380412800

;B00F942VQI;[1, 1];5.0;"Review posted on Books on Silver Wings blog.Reegan is a time traveling tour guide from 2145. He takes a group back in time to 2020 to watch a historical moment. Silvia from the group uses this chance to run away from her husband and escapes into 2020. She doesn't know that she's living on borrowed time and she will be killed by universal design if she doesn't return to her correct time, 2145. Reegan enlists Saul's help to find her. Unfortunately, by associating with a person in 2020, Reegan too is in danger of randomly dying and murder by Silvia's husband.I love the time travel and the paradox effects in the story. The science fiction elements are well explained but are not a forefront of the story. They don't compete with the romance between Reegan and Saul, the mystery chase to find Silvia, or the life threatening situations involving Silvia's possessive husband. The action scenes and sci-fi story line definitely keeps me reading the book. The romance between the MCs is acceptable for me.These two MCs both have their emotional scars and personal secrets. Reegan's heart is heavy with guilt over a tour trip gone wrong and someone in the trip got permanently injured. Saul is in the middle of an economic and alcoholism crisis. He lost his sister and convinced himself it was his fault. His PI business is in danger of folding and he can't escape the urge to drink. When Reegan enters his life, he's at the brink of collapsing and wasting away. Saul is wary of people, clients, and the lies Reegan tells him.But it's the need for these secrets to be revealed and how they are told that makes the story a big hit for me. Saul and Reegan both learn to trust each other and believe in each other's good intentions. The antics, drama, and verbal dodging-questions game played by the MCs are entertaining to read and show how well they &#34;clicked&#34; with each other and connected. The facts that Reegan is fated to die if he doesn't return to the future and Saul cannot cross the portal into the future makes these MCs star-crossed lovers and adds to the drama.The side characters in the story are likable too, even Silvia despite her faults with running away into the past and a bad choice in husband and Cammie whose unobtrusive and made the already happy ending even more amazing. Overall, this is an stunning sci-fi, romance, action story with star-crossed lovers and an amazing story line. The pacing is perfect for me and it's a non-stop page-turning book. I highly recommend this for fans of the star-crossed lovers trope and time traveling, science fiction novels.*review copy received in exchange for an honest review*";02 1, 2014;A2JORBS01I2SX0;Books on Silver Wings;it's a non-stop page-turning book;1391212800

OtterBox Commuter Series Case for iPhone 5c - Retail Packaging Protective Case for iPhone - Black;B00F9OQRZE;[0, 0];3.0;I am loyal to Otterbox, is the only case I feel good about using on my IPhone (past and previous), my daughter's IPod (past and previous, and my husband's IPhone.  I know they are well protected with the Otterbox.  I loved this case when I received it.  I usually go for the Defender Series, but this time I wanted something less bulky.  This case was exactly that!  After using it for a few days, several people I spoke with on my phone said that my voice sounded muffled or that they could not understand me.  I could not imagine the problem being the phone, I had just received it.  I removed the case and made a few phone calls.  Those I spoke to said they could now understand me and my voice sounded clearer.  I never had this issue with the Defender Series and do not know if this is a common problem with this case.  I then ordered the Symmetry Series by Otterbox.  I have not experienced the same problem with the Symmetry Series.  Looking at the bottoms of the cases, all I can figure is that the lip on the bottom of the Commuter Series is thicker than the bottom lip on the Symmetry Series.  Not sure why I experienced this problem...;03 30, 2014;A110M2KRZB0IS3;heather;OtterBox Commuter Series;1396137600

OtterBox Commuter Series Case for iPhone 5c - Retail Packaging Protective Case for iPhone - Black;B00F9OQRZE;[3, 4];1.0;"The iPhone 5C Commuter does not have all the features Otterbox claims on their website.

Otterbox specifically indicates Commuter cases are to protect against dust.  Amazon even indicates this case includes ""port plugs"" in its description, which also is wrong.  The 5C Commuter has a big open hole in the bottom of the case with no port covers.  Also, there is no 2-layer protection on the bottom of the case either.Some of the recent 5 star reviews seem suspect.

Summit Nutritions Pure Garcinia Cambogia Extract, With More Than 60 % Hca, 750 Mg, 120 Veggie Capsules, 120 Count;B00FA9D8FK;[1, 1];3.0;If you are looking for a Garcinia cambogia product to try, this appears to be a good one. Derived from the rind of the tamarind fruit, it is reputedly effective in blocking fat, burning fat, boosting energy and depressing the appetite. One capsule should be taken twice a day with six ounces of water thirty minutes before meals. Made in the US, this supplement contains 60% of HCA, the active ingredient, as well as calcium and potassium. There are no fillers, binders or artificial ingredients. The capsules are dark green and easy to swallow.But the real question is whether they work. After taking them for almost a month, I can't say I have noticed a difference. Designed to be an adjunct to a healthy diet and exercise program, they cannot be expected to do it all themselves. But I haven't lost any more weight than I usually do on my current regimen and haven't observed any of the purported benefits.Still it appears to be sourced and manufactured with care. Many people attest to its benefits Perhaps it is the placebo effect or perhaps it is a question of body chemistry. But if you are inclined to experiment, this product seems to be safe and well made. Each bottle contains 120 capsules, or a sixty day supply if used as directed. The expiration date on my bottle was 09/16.;03 21, 2014;A2OCDK0BOW6UCY;Antigone Walsh;Didn't Do It For  Me;1395360000

;B00FCY77DC;[0, 0];5.0;No words could describe how I felt about this story, being the first of six. Being drugged, raped, and beaten is a real life situation, that no one should be put through, even though it does happen.This book is graphic, telling the story about a 17 year old Mia who comes from a privileged family. I really wanted to beat Mia's father, due to his arrogance and not being there for his daughter because of his political career. I had to put my Nook down when she explained that women who have been raped, can't get pregnant because the person's body would reject it. Just made me want to kill her father even more. Knowing her attacker, the one person who is allied with her father, she is faced with challenges to either do the right thing, or go along with what some are telling her to do, which isn't the right thing. This person hasn't done this act just once, but to several other women, and Mia is the only one who has any memory. Trying to learn to cope with the situation, she finds peace inside her closet. Afraid to leave her home for any reason, she has her best friend, Ari, to help her out along the way. She learns something at the end of the of the book that shakes her world even more, and I really can't wait to see what happens.This story is beautifully written, giving insight into a person's world of outcome, consequences, and tough decisions. I loved Mia for her courage, and I really hope things work out for the best in the end of the sixth book.;09 23, 2013;A2IR4H2Z0QTS3V;"Amazon Customer ""Amanda""";Sad, heartbreaking story;1379894400

In a fatal contest between the decedents of the famed Knights Templar and the Knights of Malta supported by their ruthless assassins known as The Hasshishans, Trevor Hawk finds himself caught up in the battle for the possession of the this implement of incredible power.

;B00FENJVOE;[12, 23];5.0;"Let's just start with the reviewers who are saying that this expansion came with very little content and that it is not worth it.  This statement is simply false.  It boggles my mind that people can play a game that has been out for less than 24 hours and believe they can say thus game is terrible.I am an avid Starcraft II and Diablo III player and have been for years.  Let me just say that Diablo was certainly in need of change and this expansion (so far) has shown a lot of promise and is a whole lot of fun.I am sad that they only added one character but what a character!  The new class balances casting and melee in a very fun way.  If you have ever played the Paladin from Diablo II you are on the right track to what this new class is all about but with many fun new skills to play with.To all the haters focusing mainly on the ""short"" fifth act as being a poor addition I say shame on you all.  The things that made Diablo III kinda boring or lame are gone or changed for the better.  The auction house was plagued with people making fake or real money off other peoples bad decisions and is now finished and gone.  Loot 2.0 has mad grinding a lot better knowing that at any moment a truly legendary item can drop.  As for my old items on any of my characters?  Good riddance I would trade them all for brimstones and soon enough I will.Finally, I won't spoil all the new goodies but there is a lot new and better about this game.  I am absolutely happy to grind grind and grind some more if it means I get to find my own items and that is essentially what the expansion is all about.  Love it or hate it, I am just so darn glad I dont have to sell this item for hopefully a good price to attempt to afford the price set by somebody else!

;B00FENJVOE;[1, 5];4.0;This is a step in the right direction for Diablo, I really like where they are heading and looking forward to upcoming patch releases. The release of the expansion was smooth and there were no issues in regards to lag, etc. I enjoy the new Act, however, I do feel like it's a tad short, actually, I feel like this whole expansion was pretty short. Going from 60-70 was fairly easy and I was expecting it to be harder.  I have a 70 Crusader with over 1M Damage  and end game is pretty much two things: farming bounty bags & rifting. The crusader is good, but I feel like not all classes are balanced -- Wizards need a nerf. Overall, I feel this game is not worth the $40, it seems a bit pricey for the amount of content they offer, however,  I'm happy, but it is starting to become very repetitive...;04 3, 2014;A1ITAAHRTTS7XD;"SM ""Fino""";Great improvement from original Diablo 3 release;1396483200

When I opened the package I thought I'd gotten a battery for my Blade 120 SR heli. I didn't think this could possibly fit in the X4. But it does fit (see product pics I added). And it flies too!  Seemed like very little trim was necessary from using the std batt to get the nose down. I just got this battery and have only flown once. Didn't time it but it seemed much longer than the std battery. For the price it seems ok. I'd rate it 4.5 out of 5 if I could. But since it took almost 3 weeks to get I'll settle for 4 stars.The only potential downsides here is continually jamming this thing in the back of the X4 might eventually damage the innards,and the extra mass of the battery might tend to make crashes cause more damage. I'd recommend it if your looking for a higher capacity battery. Remember that just because it's double the rating, you don't get double the flight time. The extra weight steals away from that.

;B00FJ433QK;[2, 2];5.0;This book was mind-blowing, this is the only way to describe it!! The synopsis was what drew my interest in the beginning, it sounded like the premise of a great creepy movie. I am so glad that I had the opportunity to get to know each and everyone of these characters, Serena was my favorite by far but Walter's character was exceptional!! The story line was very easy to follow and I loved that it revealed the story present and past little by little to build up the suspense. By the end you had two spectacular stories intricately woven together to give the reader the full picture of what they think is going to happen, but your in for a surprise!!! This was a definite page turner and at times had me on the edge of my seat with anticipation. Stephanie Elmas's  writing style was very refreshing and unique. I will most definitely be recommending  to friends and family and will be impatiently waiting for her next novel. Great Job!!!!;11 7, 2013;A3Q7XBBNY0SV3N;"BookNerd1980 ""Billie Jo""";Mind-Blowing Read!!!!!;1383782400
;B00FJ433QK;[5, 7];5.0;Stephanie Elmas beautifully divides her time between the present and the 1890s.  The story becomes captivating from the very early pages as Serena approaches the Kensington residence of the Hartreve family.  Her insight into the family's relationships and history is wonderfully unfolded as the book reaches its peak.Elmas moves the reader skillfully from the present to the Victorian age.  From Miranda and Tristan Whitestone's disastrous marriage, Tristan's affair with the beautiful and exciting Lucinda Eden and all its consequences that carry into the 21st century.I loved the larger than life character Walter Balanchine, an East End mystic who steps into the scene with all sorts of bottles and charms around his neck.  He captures the gothic Victorian underbelly of the novel superbly.The growing tension and the haunting love story that unfold make it hard to put the book down.  I thoroughly enjoyed The Room Beyond and can't wait to read what Elmas has in store for us next.;10 2, 2013;A1BU58VM49HCNZ;J.Frank;Gripping page turner;1380672000

;B00FJ6CL2K;[1, 1];4.0;"After my first workout with LL&A;, I wasn't impressed.  It was OK, but I didn't fall in love with it and actually thought about 'releasing' it from my collection.  Then I decided to give it another shot, as it was listed on my Dec 2013 Rotation from Cathe.  I am glad I did, because I liked it much better the second time around.LL&A; focuses on isolating the quad muscle as much as possible, which is hard to do without a leg extension machine.  It is the perfect training companion to the Great Glutes, also released by Cathe in this series where the focus is on the outer thighs and glutes.The workout warms you up and moves into the standing weighted section.  Then there is a short chair section, which basically means you need something to hold onto while you work the quad muscle.  There is a floorwork leg section, before you move into the ab work.All in all, it's an efficient workout for the legs and abs, with the focus on the quad muscle.  It pairs well with the Great Glutes, and the pair will be a nice 'set' on days when you want to workout the legs without a lot of pylo work.";12 10, 2013;A3D1RYGOR76013;A Busy Reader;Focus on the front of the legs and the abs - good low-impact leg day workout;1386633600

HP Chromebook 11 (White/Blue);B00FJXVRM8;[2, 3];4.0;"This is my second Chromebook having passed down my Samsung 11.6"" model from last year to my daughter. I have been a Mac user since 2002 personally and Windows professionally. I did not need to buy another MacBook and I have tried Windows 8 on 3 different budget laptops. The Chromebook I had last year seemed to work best for me when I wanted something other than an iPad to read and respond to email, catch up on social media, casual web surfing, and light writing in Google Docs.When I saw this new Chrombook 11 announced I thought it would be a great upgrade from the Samsung and it is, and it isn't.The design with the Google influence is great. I like the white plastic and rounded edges, much like the white MacBook I had years ago. The keyboard is great. Travel is perfect and it feels solid. The screen is amazing for a device in this price range. It is not a retina display but the blacks are rich, whites are bright, and I can read text easily - which is the most important thing really. Battery life so far seems fine for my needs and the micro USB charger is the perfect size to toss in a bag, I really hate the design of most laptop chargers, just too big to lug around. The track-pad works fine for me, some have said it is not great and it will never be as responsive as the glass on on a new MacBook Air but this is also over $700 cheaper. I am actually using an extra Apple Magic Mouse via Bluetooth and it works fine so far. The speakers are under the keyboard and are some of the best I have ever heard on a device of this size. You will not wake the neighbors but they don't distort and listening to music as I type this is actually a nice experience.The performance is average. I wish Google/HP would have bumped up the processor and memory. The 16GB of storage is fine since you store everything in the cloud anyway but you do see some lag watching videos full screen and web pages sometimes take a little longer to load than expected. I am also surprised the omitted an i/o for an SD card. There are decent, basic photo editors available and you can upload to Google Drive, Google+ or other sites. It's not a deal breaker but since the Samsung had it at a lower price point it should be here as well. Many have complained about USB 2.0 but I never took advantage of the 3.0 on the Samsung so again, not a deal breaker to me.All in all, this is a great buy. Its light, easy to type on, has a great screen, and will work well for my needs. That is the key thing to think about when buying a Chromebook, how it will work for you. If you already are comfortable with Google services and do not need traditional programs like MS Office and Photoshop you should be fine. I have actually started talking family members into Chromebooks when replacing old laptops because they only use them for web and email.HP is releasing another model this month with a 14"" screen which will start at $299 and include a better processor but the screen on the Chromebook 11 makes it the one for me.";11 4, 2013;A21992ULAMNFZL;Jason K.;Perfect for the right expectation;1383523200

;B00FM24N5E;[2, 2];3.0;Married to Madness, by Devin Shane, is a sort of Mr. and Mrs. Smith style story that follows Zack and Brandon Cerasani.  They have what appears to be the typical marriage that everyone wants.  They are a wealthy couple in Philadelphia with a beautiful house and children.  They are constantly giving back to their community through charity events, like anyone of their stature would, and for this people covet them, but it's what people don't see that makes them different.  Zack and Brandon are vigilante killers by night, and it's only when they learn each others secret that Zack has to make a choice.All in all I found the book to be pretty decent.  There were times where I felt that it was just to obvious and predictable, which really ruins a story for me, but in this case it wasn't enough so to make me stop reading the book.  Another thing that kind of put me off of the book was that this story (for the most part) has already been done.  Yes, the author does throw in a little twist that I left out of the review, but I was really hoping for something a little more original.  So all in all a good read, but I was hoping for just a little more. I will be looking forward to trying another title by this author in the future.;01 26, 2014;AYP0RUJOSVKAJ;Tiffany L.

;B00FPR9RWU;[0, 0];4.0;What a great story. Karla is a struggling girl living in the French Quarter. She's down on luck trying to figure out how she's going to pay rent and just generally maintain her life when she's approached by a gentleman at Cafe Du Monde who offers an opportunity that will pay her enough to get her life back on track. Nope! It's not what  you're thinking :-)  She is offered the 'opportunity' to try and sell a historic house on a plantation. Karla has previous experience in real estate so ultimately, given her circumstances, she accepts. Now it's nowhere near as straightforward as this sounds. She has to move onto the property and her whole life changes. There are many twists and turns, interesting characters, hobnobbing (yes, that's a word) with the rich and weird, frightening encounters 'and' some spooky ones. Interestingly the staff in the house appear to be characters borrowed from Gone with the Wind's depiction of slaves. I'm not sure the reason for that but otherwise it's a great read and leaves you hoping there will be more stories in the future featuring Karla, Albert and her life in New Orleans.;04 8, 2014;A346Z5D3988CD9;Masaba;Great story;1396915200

Cutter Backwoods Dry 25-Percent DEET Aerosol Spray, 4-Ounce;B00FQGS8HU;[2, 2];5.0;"I spend a lot of time in the prairie and in heavily wooded areas watching birds and also as a forest preserve volunteer. Mosquitoes and ticks are horrible when the weather gets warm and rainy. I treat my clothing with Permethrin, but on any exposed skin I use bug spray. I dislike the smell and the greasy residue which results in me not using enough of it and still getting a few mosquito bites. I was happy to try the Cutter backwoods version (I had been using a different brand).I have used the Cutter&#8217;s on several four-hour hikes and have not had any mosquito bites or picked up any ticks. There were a lot of mosquitoes and bugs flying around but none landed on me. Just to be sure this wasn&#8217;t a fluke, I used the other brand (a non-deep woods version with a lesser amount of deet) and after less than an hour had two itchy mosquito bites.I have sensitive skin so am always worried that a new-to-me product will cause irritation, but I was fine I had no skin reactions using the Cutter Backwoods formula (although I do wash off the spray as soon as I get home).The Cutter spray proved to be a superior product. In addition to keeping away the bugs, it&#8217;s pleasant to use. It goes on dry and has a mild scent. The nozzle produces a steady, even spray and doesn&#8217;t leak. Plus it locks in place when closed so I don&#8217;t have to worry about it leaking in my bag or in the car.";06 29, 2014;A1IDWUYX4QXTUE;Leslie;Stops bugs from biting and is pleasant to use;1404000000
Cutter Backwoods Dry 25-Percent DEET Aerosol Spray, 4-Ounce;B00FQGS8HU;[0, 0];5.0;"All I hear about for Alaska is the number one thing you need is DEET bug spray, so this will do the job nicely. It's a nice slim container which should fit well when packing a backpack. I only wish the manufacturers would get on board with the TSA requirements for a 3oz limit. This will have to be checked&#8212;which is fine in this particular case, but often I travel with carry-on only. If you travel light as well, you will need to look for a smaller bug repellent. If you worry about chemicals on your skin, remember that you can always spray it on your clothing itself. Try a little on your shirt collar, sleeves, etc.  Cutter has always done well for us in the past, so we will stick with this brand.";06 18, 2014;AZ9WQM7SLUX7E;"Tracy Foote ""College Savings Plan Author, Pho...";Sending this with my son to Alaska;1403049600

Laughing Hazard: Do not read Adams and Eve in public unless you want to explain while you're rolling around on the floor laughing your derriere off.I read Adams and Eve at the VA while I was there to do my volunteer work.  It was a slow day.  I sit at a desk in a large waiting room with very little to absorb sound, so my peals of laughter echoed down the waiting room and through the hall.  And there were a lot of peals of laughter.  Of course, this was my sixth trip to Liberty Heights, New Jersey and I love its denizens, both human and animal, so I laugh at inside jokes as well as the obvious ones--like Wayne's ESP.  Wayne is a beagle.  Or LouAnn Friedbush's spelling.  She means, ""Come as an Addams.""  She dresses as Morticia, her boyfriend Howie Fleischowitz is Gomez, and Wayne is Cousin Itt for a few minutes at least.  He isn't fond of his costume.BettyAnn and her boyfriend show up unannounced without costumes, but they're weird enough not to need them.  Simon P. Stein, the wanna-be vampire, more closely resembles Herman Munster--and doesn't like the sight of blood.So, LouAnn's expecting a Pugsley and a Wednesday or two, maybe an attempt at a Lurch, a few Uncle Festers and possibly another Morticia.  What she gets are John and Abigail Adams, Don Adams as Maxwell Smart with his faithful Agent 99, and a plethora of rather obscure Adamses plus a gorilla who Wayne clearly doesn't like.Yuppers!  Halloween Liberty Heights style is both hilarious and memorable.  But you'll have to buy the book to find out who the gorilla is.  I highly recommend it.

However, the brushes are narrow and you need to make sure there is enough polish on it for nail application.

Yakima Handcuff Lock for New Swingdaddy and Ridgebacks;B00FUHDRBW;[11, 11];5.0;A bought new 4 bike Yakima Ridgeback this year and was looking for a way to secure the bikes on the rack. This model specific locking system was easy to install and provides a very quick and convenient way to lock bikes onto the rack. It takes just seconds to pull the cable from its resting position inside the hitch to lock the frames of the bikes to the rack itself. I really like that Yakima included an extra key cartridge that I could install on the hitch lock. Having one key for both this lock and the rack is very convenient.The only potential downside is that the lock cable is not a really large enough gauge to deter or prevent professional thieves from using a large bolt cutter. No locking system is perfect, but for 95% of uses I have for the lock, it is just fine. If I am ever in need or more security (such as leaving the bikes on the rack overnight at a hotel) I will add security with a Kryptonite lock.;04 5, 2014;A100U06UGSJXBA;William S.

;B00FUZQZZO;[0, 0];4.0;"Plain Jayne was such a sweet best friends to lover&#8217;s story. The relationship between the two friends Jayne and Nick was very sweet and funny. I think I had a smile on my face for most of the book.Jayne Morgan left her home town right after high school graduation but now she is back fifteen years later. She has come back to take over her grandmothers bookstore after her death. With no family left, the only person she has to turn for help is her best friend since kindergarten, Nick. From the day they became friends Nick has always looked out for Jayne and took care of her. Living with a grandmother that never showed her affection, Nick was the one who did. He would hug her until she would push him away. For Nick nothing has changed between him and Jayne, she is still his best friend that he wants to spend all his time with and help as much as he can. Jayne keeps pushing away feelings she&#8217;s had for Nick for a very long time and doing her best to give him space, so she won&#8217;t come between him and any of his relationships. The more time they spend together the more things start to change between Nick and Jayne. Nick starts to see and feel things for Jayne that he was too blind to see before and Jayne still thinks Nick see her only as the plain Jayne she thinks she is.Plain Jayne was definitely lite on the angst and steam but made up for it with sweet Nick and funny supporting characters. One of my favorite&#8217;s parts of the book was at the beginning of every chapter started with a quote from a character in a John Hughes movie.

Force Factor Test X180 Testosterone Booster -- 60 Capsules;B00FZNHBHM;[16, 78];1.0;I ordered this for my husband to try during our insanity 60 day program.  He is 27 and in excellent shape. The website says this will improve muscle growth,  energy,  and stamina during workouts and in the bedroom.  Seemed like a great product. My husband hasn't noticed any difference after a few weeks now.  BUT, I HAVE.  And not in a good way.  WARNING- THIS PRODUCT CAN MAKE YOU ANGRY. What was to improve sex life has interferred greatly.  My husband has had a bad temper,  loses control very easily,  and has not been himself. We have been together for 10 years and very rarely fight or even argue.  We haven't been talking for 3 days now. He doesn't even realize how he's been acting.  Its honestly almost scary.  Be careful with this drug.  I DO NOT recommend this product to young men with plenty of testosterone. Workout and eat right and you will have plenty of energy and stamina.

Tried refrigeration - wouldn't pour. Eventually a niece suggested Barnea Olive Oil. I searched and found some at Amazon. From New Zealand! Read many references on the Internet. Tried it. Although it's expensive, thanks to the air-tight container it lasts a long time - so, not so expensive after all. And the taste: exquisite! I like it. Slightly buttery. Slightly peppery.

Runtastic Libra Bluetooth Smart Scale and Body Analyzer;B00G3YIDHE;[26, 27];3.0;"Ok, this is a ""connected smart scale"" right?  So this review is in two parts: the scale, and the integration.Hardware (Scale):  Looks nice, glass top, clear display, instant-on.  Seems accurate as compared to another scale. It includes ""carpet feet"", but when used on thick carpet, the measurement is inaccurate by about 50%.  I'd say they're more ""bath mat feet"". 4 Stars.Connection (iOS app): Easy to set up and link the scale over bluetooth.  Can configure multiple profiles, and the scale knows which user is on it.  But literally EVERY TIME I've used it, it says my body makeup has changed and needs to calibrate.  Every once in a while I'll abide and do a calibration measurement, but it IMMEDIATELY says again that my body has changed and needs to calibrate.  Again.  Annoying.  There's an in-app purchase to set weight/BF% goals, and to eliminate ads.  But not the Runtastic ads, you CAN'T eliminate those! 3 Stars.Software (Runtastic website): I'm in the US, and I don't know if it's because the website is hosted in the UK, but it's slow to access.  The iOS app automatically sends your measurement to the website for logging, but ONLY weight and bodyfat.  The other stats are not saved on the website for review.  Runtastic tech said it's 'coming soon' but that was a month ago.  You cannot import weight logs you've been keeping elsewhere, though you can manually enter them, which is very very slow with lots of clicking (you can't type the date, you have to click it on a calendar).  You cannot export weight logs from Runtastic for use in other tools.  Saving activities on the website is tedious and buggy.  For example, enter an exercise, type a value in ""Calories"" (which turns the checkmark green, meaning it knows there's a value to submit), submit, and the saved activity doesn't have your calorie count.  Edit it, enter the calories AGAIN, and update, then it finally saves.  Frustrating.  Since the site is slow to load, you might be ready to proactively click a button, but OH NO!  There's an ad for ""Runtastic GOLD Membership"" that shifts the entire page down about 50 pixels after 5 seconds, so you've now just clicked on something else.  1 Star.UPDATE (3/12/2014): Regarding the website, true to their word, the other stats (muscle, bone, tissue, water) are now logged and visible on the website.  You can also now manually enter logs on the website using your keyboard to type the date.  This means you could use a macro to mass import old logs, though far from an ideal solution.  The other website issues remain. (Slow, Calories not saving, Gold Ad banner)";12 27, 2013;A150CJ3DPKWUE2;Thomas A. Burritt;Scale is pretty good, app and website not so much;1388102400

If that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for, then you might be better served with Beats Wireless or other wireless headset.I think this headset is easiest explained if you compare it to a TV.  With a TV you can connect your DVD player to it. .  .a TiVo box to it. .  .perhaps a Roku device to it. . . and so on.  Then you use the input button to switch between them.  It&#8217;s similar with this headset.  There is a &#8220;box&#8221; which you plug-in to the power.  Then you set-up the &#8220;box&#8221; to work with your computer and game box(es).The sound quality is fine with plenty of bass.  The headset is comfortable to wear.  There is a built-in microphone which you can pull-out if desired, which is convenient.One nice feature is that two batteries are included.  One can be in the headset and the other charging in the &#8220;box&#8221; so you will never run out of power.You can &#8220;share&#8221; the audio with someone by connection to the headset, which is kind of cool.Overall it&#8217;s a nice headset, and I&#8217;m sure &#8220;gamers&#8221; will love it. . . but again. . . if you&#8217;re simply looking for a headset for &#8220;general use&#8221;, then this is not the one for you.";02 4, 2014;AVU1ILDDYW301;G.

Also the range on these is very good too.  Not that I wander too far when playing, but if you need to it is no problem.  I used these to listen to music and I was able to roam all throughout the house with no static or drop out.There are several audio selections and it allows you to tailor the sound for each use case.  I don't like surround sound for music, so I turn that feature off when listening to music. But I do tend to turn it on while gaming.  I was suspect at how surround sound would work with a headset, but you can get some spacial appreciation with these.  The only downside to the audio is no active noise cancellation.

;B00G7RESK8;[0, 0];5.0;Well, that was speechlessness-inducing....  Wow.  I mean, my heart doesn't really know what to do with itself right now.  Seriously, I finished this in the wee hours of the morning, and then couldn't go to sleep b/c I just kept thinking about it all.  I enjoyed Starbright, but *this* book was ....just, perfect.  I can't even put into words how many different emotions went through me while reading this book.  This is Ms. Higginson at her finest.  Her characters are so well developed that you can't help but love them, even when you want to shake them sometimes.  They're not perfect, but they weasel their way into your heart so that you feel everything they're going through.Stella....Stella Stella Stella.  I'm still not all into the whole love triangle, but I must admit that it was dealt with so much better in this book.  I could see more of what was going on with her, and she was less wishy-washy.  And we go to see her grow more.  She could be so strong and so vulnerable at the same time.  I can see her potential for bad-assery, and I am thoroughly looking forward to her coming into her own.Seth.  I can't even talk about Seth.  It's not like the blurb for this book didn't hint at what was going to happen with him, but you can't even begin to imagine how much it's going to rip your heart out until you're reading Ms. Higginson's heartbreaking words.  I can't go there....but, just wow.And the chemistry?  DAMN can Ms. Higginson write chemistry.  I mean, just....omg, wow.I'm also thoroughly intrigued by Jude.  That's another thing I have always loved about Ms. Higginson's books and characters -- they are complex, not completely black and white.  I can't decide how I feel, but I know he's going to be important.Oh, oh oh....and you know what else I love about this series?  Stella has a family.  So many of these books have orphaned heroines...and don't get me wrong, I actually like that b/c it makes the heroines who they are.  But this one is different, b/c Stella has these strong parents who really love her, and Ms Higginson makes it work.  It shouldn't, but it totally does, and I love that.OK, so, enough fangirling....  Even if you were meh on Starbright, READ THIS BOOK!!!  Or if you haven't read Starbright, go read that and then READ THIS BOOK!  You won't regret it....;10 27, 2013;A1B88VE5O3J9CQ;Lenore L Kosinski;Exactly what this series needed;1382832000

;B00G8UVD66;[2, 3];5.0;"I was asked to read this novella in exchange for an honest review, and I truly adored it!This is a very sweet novella by Katy Regnery, and if you've read By Proxy, you'll be glad to hear mention of some familiar characters!!Tess ""Tessie"" Branson is a waitress at the local diner, who's past has earned her the nickname ""Fast Tessie"". She's no stranger to being used and tossed aside by men, and since she's never opened her heart to any of them, that was always okay. Until one night, when Tess has a rough night at work with some customers and their snarky mouths, she heads outside sans jacket to cool off under the stars in the cool mountain air, and is joined by the short-order cook, Lucas.Lucas has worked there for 4 months since his release from prison, and he's noticed Tess, but hasn't spoken to her. Figuring he has nothing to offer her as an ex-con, why bother? He noticed that she hurried outside without her coat, so he requests to go on break in order to see that she's alright after the mishap with the jerks and take her her coat. At the end of their conversation not only does she notice that he's genuinely being 'nice' to her and maintaining eye contact to her actual eyes, and not her breasts, he asks her to do a pretty off the wall thing. For a tough guy at least =PMake a wish on a star before you come in,"" he said softly, without turning to face her.""It's Christmastime. It might come true.""This is Ms. Regnery's second book I've read and once again, I loved it. It made me feel so warm and fuzzy inside, I couldn't help but smile as I read it.

;B00G9AN5HK;[1, 1];5.0;"I was one of Ms. McNaron's students quite early in her career, so I'm grateful for her skills in challenging young minds to seek expansions in their thinking.  As the saying goes, ""A teacher affects Infinity...they never know where their influence stops.""  Very true for Toni McNaron.  This book is a personal account of Toni's paradoxical journey into the conflicts between traditional spiritual experience and scholastic, earthly, feminist, LGBT thought.  It is, perhaps, her skill as a professor that has brought her, literally, to her knees...to her knees in church, and to her knees in her garden.  Plants, too, live in a paradox: one part free in the sun and air, and the other rooted to the conditions of the earth.  This book allows us to share Ms. McNaron's conflicted need for both the earth and the sky, and to perhaps remember, as I did, that spirit and critical thinking can indeed live together in peace.  And, when we are really brave,  to challenge our thinking to expand, even within the dogma of the Roman Catholic Church.";11 20, 2013;A1YBL85SSRLVS5;"Lynda Wells ""THE WAY TO WELLNESS.COM""";A Teacher's  Transformative Journey;1384905600

Orbit Baby G3 Toddler Convertible Car Seat, Black;B00GHM87GY;[2, 3];3.0;First off I think it's ridiculous a car seat that mostly talks about the convenience of being able to swivel your kid getting in and out that doesn't come with the base is a little confusing. I assumed it did. So now I'm wondering if I should fork out the extra 215 for the base, but I'm not in love with this car seat. If you decide to buy the base it now becomes a 600+ car seat, seems a little steep and ridiculous to me.My daughter is rear facing, this one seems to be oddly more up right than my current car seat. I also don't think she looks comfortable in it. Also where's a cup holder? Seriously? For 400 there's not even a single cup holder?This was a pain to put into my Rogue, it would fit much better in a larger SUV. This definitely won't be going in my husbands challenger.Do lots of research before forking out all the money for this car seat. If you can take a look at it at a local store, I'd highly recommend that, I searched here in salt lake and couldn't find them in store, physically. You can buy it but there's nothing to look at.;06 26, 2014;A1R1BFJCMWX0Y3;Shoe queen;What? 400 and no base?;1403740800

"Organic SpiruZan&reg;: Highest Rated Organic Spirulina &amp; Astaxanthin - USDA Certified Organic";B00GHYQTZS;[9, 10];5.0;So I've been taking Spirulina for about 6 months now and I absolutely love it. But just like everyone else, I've always  struggled to stomach the terrible smell and taste of the powdered Spirulina.I started taking this product about 4 weeks ago and love it for quit a few reasons. Firstly, the tablets are much easier to stomach than the powder, no more terrible taste and smell. Secondly, this product not only contains Spirulina it also has another amazing micro-algae called Astaxanthin. Just like Spirulina, Astaxanthin is another superfood micro-algae that has a whole array of health benefits. So having both together in the same daily supplement makes its even better.I'm a vegetarian and take the supplement as a daily multi-vitamin. Upon taking it my body feels refreshed and has a feeling of vitality. I also noticed I have more energy and mental clarity throughout the day.I also really like Spirulina because it contains nearly all of the essential and non-essential amino acids, which is great for me as a vegetarian because I do not consume as much protein as others with standard diets.I also really like Triquetra Health's organic SpiruZan because of the source of their ingredients. They currently use Parry Organic Spirulina, which is the highest quality source of Spirulina available. From my research I see that Parry has more organic certifications and accreditations than any other source of Spirulina. Their Spirulina also has a much higher nutrient density than other Organic Spirulina's, which often come from China.I highly recommend this product to anybody. And I definitely recommend it to any vegetarian or vegan who only likes to take wholefood supplements, this product will help you obtain the nutrients you often miss out on due to your diet.Hope this review was helpful.

;B00GI1J5LA;[0, 0];5.0;The Reunion is a wonderfully well-written horror novel that will leave even those who aren't typical fans of the genre unable to put it down! It follows the story of a group of people together for a high school reunion but almost as soon as starts, this soon descends into a world of horror and thrilling 'end-of-the-seat moments'. Usually I'm quite sceptical of horror books because unlike the category suggests, so many are just made of the same repeated storyline's and really aren't exciting in the slightest. Fortunately in 'The Reunion' A.A Pencil expertly weaves nightmarish scenes with gripping plot twists as he charts the growing paranoia of the remaining reunion guests. At times I often felt as if I could no longer keep reading but as you'll find, once you've started it's almost impossible to stop! I love that a book can actually achieve this effect as it's something usually reserved for the scariest of films, and this is testament to Pencil's effectiveness as a writer . I thoroughly recommend the book and I can't wait for the next instalment in the 'Beneath the Trap Door' series!;03 11, 2014;A1RYQPQ01T5D5R;Skyler Allen;You will be scared senseless but love every minute;1394496000
Alaska Bear Dual Layer Holster Rugged Armor Hybrid Case with Kickstand and Locking Belt Swivel Clip For Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Note III N9000(Note 3 Black);B00GIS3M7G;[0, 0];5.0;"I was provided an Alaska Bear Dual Layer Holster Clip Case (iPhone 5/5S Version) for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.What You Should Know Before You Buy:&#9830; Great dual layer design with cushion core and hard shell (similar to my favorite Incipio Dual PRO Case).&#9830; Nice rugged holster with strong swivel clip.&#9830; Two different stands, one in holster and one on back of case.  Both work well.&#9830; A little difficult to slide phone out of the holster, but holds the case very strongly.&#9830; Not perfect, but 5 Star rating is based on the extremely low $8 price point (the price at the time of this review).Conclusion:Overall, this is a very nice holster case for an iPhone 5/5S.  It has a great design with a soft, cushion internal case and a hard outer shell giving your phone quite a bit of protection.  It is build very similar to an Incipio Dual PRO Case that I consider to be the perfect case and I use on a daily basis.  The Alaska Bear case fits my iPhone 5S perfectly and all of the buttons and ports on the case are easily accessible.  The back of the case has a flip out stand that functions well and is pretty sturdy.  The belt clip holster also works very well.  The phone case fits in it tightly and feels very sturdy.  It can be a little difficult to slide the phone out of the holster, but that may loosen over time, or you can just turn the phone around and use the phone in the holster.  The belt clip also acts as a second stand while the phone is in the holster.  If you are looking for a belt clip iPhone 5/5S case at a great price, this one is worth a look.";01 17, 2014;A3V5F050GVZ56Q;Dre;What You Should Know Before You Buy!;1389916800

;B00GJMBFS4;[1, 1];5.0;"Liron Fine's &#8220;At God's Mercy&#34; is a suspense thriller that follows the journey of two 50-something identical twins as they travel through Poland, trying to piece together their past.The novel is set in motion when Rabbi Jeremiah Neumann discovers he has a long-lost twin brother, who is a priest.It was interesting to see how the brothers put their religious differences aside to focus on their goal of uncovering their past.Once in Poland, the brothers find an unexpected evil that manifests itself gradually, in addition to their history.I was excited to feel the pace of the plot quicken once the twins reach Poland.I believe one of the strongest attributes of the book is its social commentary.Fine has a knack for making the reader think about about religion, relationships, and human nature itself.For example, there is a subplot involving Jeremiah's strained relationship with his daughter, Eva, who is romantically involved with a Christian.The ability of &#34;At God's Mercy&#34; to make the reader ask questions, as well as its ability to put the reader on the edge of his or hear seat, make it a must-read for any suspense-thriller fan.";01 5, 2014;A22FYOW7753XEI;Rich Blaisdell;Suspense and social commentary;1388880000

;B00GM7STPI;[5, 5];4.0;"Imagine if ""Saving Mr. Banks"" had been called ""Walt."" Imagine, then, the howling of its audience and reviewers that the film covered just his relationship with P.L. Travers, and that it didn't capture more of his life and complex personality. This ""Walt"" doesn't match what people had envisioned, given all that we know about Walt Disney and his impact on our time.Such is the problem with ""Diana."" It should have been called ""Diana and the Doctor"" (terrible but I can't think of anything better right now) or something like ""An Affair to Remember.""I've now seen Diana twice, and I think that the slew of bad reviews was unfair. I think it's a good little movie. And I think that Naomi's performance was brilliant. She was so brave to take it on, and she admirably walked a fine line between mimicry and relaxing into the role. I think everybody had their own Diana movie in their head, and this film couldn't live up to their expectations.A key to it is ""Brief Encounter,"" mentioned by Naveen Andrews in the interview with him on the DVD. He had that film in mind when he accepted role. Made in 1945, it was a simple film that's a tiny masterpiece. Two married people meet and fall in love. They meet once a week at the movies. Then they must part. I can't remember all the details; I'm going to see it again. Anyway, ""Diana"" was a tightly focused film about a romance and its very special challenges. I wouldn't want to see a more active scene of Di with her boys, because that would shift the focus of the film. I think it was a movie that was true to its intention. I think Hasnat could have been more handsome and charismatic, as the real Hasnat is described, but Naveen was pretty good in the part nevertheless.I feel really bad for Naomi and the director, who previously directed ""Downfall."" That movie is very contained--the characters are in a bunker, after all, until the end, and the director brought this bracketing to ""Diana."" He had less than two hours to tell the story, and so he stayed with the romance and managed to also hit the notes of Diana walking in the minefield, auctioning her clothes, making secret calls to the press about her whereabouts, and several other biographical bits from that time that tied into her relationship with Hasnat.What a shame that the film bombed.

;B00GMCILB0;[2, 2];3.0;"Well there were things I loved about this book and things I hated about this book. The main thing I love about this book is Aiden, he is wonderful, loving, understanding, and sexy. I was so happy that the author did not drag on the false imprisonment thing, that made me so happy. I love how he comforts her when they go through a traumatic thing even though he is hurting too. I love how he is willing to give up everything so she can be happy. I hate to say this but I was so angry and sick of Alistair and at Jeni in many parts of this book. He was downright mean, rude, and calling her &#34;it&#34; I just wanted to punch him so bad. Jeni never letting Aiden stand up for her is getting old, I am so sick of hearing her say that she doesnt want to be the cause of them not having a relationship anymore, they are grown men let them work it out. I am so tired of reading Jeni's inner dialogue about how she is so afraid that Aiden will turn out like his father, not every son turns out like their father, really???? Jeni acted so needy when Aiden had to go to Tokyo for a week and then when she went out with Chris and Sarah she acted like a spoiled child about drinking(she cannot handle her alcohol). I think she completely overreacted about Aiden having a little rough sex with her in the shower, okay so you don't want him taking his anger out on you but this justifies not taking showers together, and her feeling shaky and afraid when she goes into that shower, give me a break, that is overkill. I hate what happened to Jeni don't get me wrong but I have never been so angry at her because of how she treated Aiden, so unfair, who wouldn't react the way he did when he saw what Jason did then her being angry at him and blaming him, really so he is supposed to stay with her every minute of every day, once again overkill.

I was nervous for what would happen to Aiden and what would become of his relationship with Jeni. Gosh, I felt so bad for Jeni. She went through so much in this book, and Alistair wasn't making things any better! He frusterated me the whole time. This time around Jeni fears that Aiden will turn out to be just like his father, controlling, angry and down right rude and agressive. I felt like she just has to get it through her head, Aiden is not like him.At times i felt bad for Aiden, Jeni constantly worries that he would turn out to be agressive and what not. She needed to understand that Aiden is a completly different person, just because Alistair is his father doesn't mean he will be like him. Jeni's past also came to light in this book. Not only was she lied and controlled in the past but Jason (her ex) was also agressive and unstable. So that made me understand where her concerns with her relationship with Aiden came from! Of course there was happy times in this read, and Aiden never fails to make me swoon! Looking forward to book 3 Miss Osborn!;01 9, 2014;A20QZJHGKDOBRA;Naughty Smutty Book Blog;4 1/2 Stars;1389225600

"Anker&reg; 7200mAh Extended Battery Combo for Samsung Galaxy S3, I9300, AT&amp;T I747, Verizon I535, T-Mobile T999, Sprint L710, U.S. Cellular R530 - TPU back cover included [18-Month Warranty]";B00GNSJU90;[1, 1];4.0;The reason I opted to purchase this product was it's source of power that it delivers to my now outdated S3. The OEM battery that came with the S3 has shown dismal longevity stamina between charges. I was getting a bare 7 hours of minimum usage before the dreaded battery warning tone was heard. I had searched for alternatives on Amazon to address this issue and stumbled upon Anker. This battery does not disappoint in this regard. My S3 is now able to go on for more than 4 days without a single battery charge. It's outstanding. However, this advantage does not come without a price.First of all, is the noticeable heft and bulk of the S3 when this battery and it's case is applied. It's ridicuolous. You can't even place it in your pants pocket (if you're a guy) comfortably. However, the S3 is light and large by it's screen dimensions, which makes it slightly unstable in the hand. I have dropped it a few times due to it's design. The heft of this Anker case makes it more stable in the hand, it anchors it, hence the name 'Anker'. Even if it is dropped, the case wraps the phone snugly and provides more than adequate protection.Secondly, the charging times for the battery is prolonged due to it's size. The battery becomes fully charged after 11 hours. So you should plan accordingly when to begin charging. You may charge the phone when it reaches 50%. It would usually takes 5 hours. So it is quite a hindrance to consider when to charge and not.Lastly, the headphone slot is somewhat tight in diameter for some jacks. It rendered my car's cassette adaptor useless. Which was disappointing.Having stated these shortcomings, I have began to use this particular battery and case for certain occasions but not as an accessory for everyday use.The product is of high quality. The Anker logo is embossed on the bottom right side corner of the case, a nice touch. You may watch the few reviews posted on YouTube for it before coming to a conclusion. The videos should give an idea of it's actual bulk before making a decision.;06 1, 2014;A2QS97GXULNLHE;projekt;A Reliable Option For Power;1401580800

The directions say to use it dry and comb out the curly hair and then cut it.  It did not work well at all.  The hair just kept getting pushed down by the combs and it wouldn't get cut.  It is a lot easier to just wet my son's hair and cut it with scissors (while keeping him distracted with a toy).The clipper is quiet and didn't both my son who hates loud noises (he yells at me for using the electric mixer or blender).

Fliptroniks Black Leather Wallet Flip Case Cover for Samsung Galaxy S5;B00GOHTGCQ;[0, 0];4.0;"Design: Looks nice and seems to be made with decent materials.  However, I do not know how it will hold up over time.  In most cases, the pleather tends to chip off and wear off the more you use it. This case has a holster for an ID, and some slots for case or other cards.  So, this could take the place of a wallet if necessary.  It would just be very bulky in the pocket.Protection: If the magnetic closure is fastened, it would protect it from a pretty decent fall.  However, if the flap opened and exposed the screen, it would get completely destroyed.  The leather is pretty grippy though so it should not fall out of your hand.  Also, the magnetic closure is pretty strong and will only come undone if you want it to.  Even with this case on though, I don t know how the phone would take a drop directly on the top or bottom.  There is less protection there.Style: this is a very nice looking case to say the least.  For women carrying it in a pocket book for use at work, this would work well and look professional.  Also, it allows you flexibility when you want to leave the house fast and not have to take a wallet; you can just take one item with all your IDs, credit cards, and cash needed.Overall, this is a decent case but I will probably not use it long term because of the thickness and I do not want a hybrid wallet case.  I&#8217;d rather use a case with a smaller form factor to keep in my pocket.  However, if you are looking for a case that also doubles of a wallet, this would be a good choice.

;B00GX9NUNG;[0, 0];4.0;Reviewer: Donna - Magic Within The PAgesRating: 4 StarsI have to actually say that this second book in the Lanistter Chronicles was really good and i was so hooked from the beginning. The story started after the death of Reid, Elyssa's mate. Things get complicated between Zeke and Elyssa as she discovers that Zeke loves her. Dmitri, Elyssa's best friend also believes he's in love with her even though he has his own mate, Olivia plus Elyssa discovers she is pregnant but doesn't know if the baby is Reids or Zeke. All three Lanistter brothers, connected to one women equals a very complicated life and did i mention they all live in a castle and are vampires! So much goes on in this book from the start and i really started warming up to the characters. I ended up reading it in a day and i was very happy that situations changed really quickly and there were no bits that were not relevant so i was constantly engrossed in it. This book marks the end of there story but the third book in the Lanistter Chronicles has new characters so i'm hoping it will be just as good as this one.**Copy received from Author in exchange for an honest review**;03 26, 2014;A18Y6RF6S79076;Magic Within the Pages;Great!!;1395792000

;B00H324XOW;[0, 0];3.0;"The story and its first book have promise. Problem wasn;t the grammar (which I suggest to the author join a local writers critique group--what I do), but the inconsistencies of the characters. One: I do not like one of the lead characters, the doctor. Once he realizes these werewolves can do, he talks about saving life and due to keeping his mouth shut about the first werewolf in the first book in the series, causes needless death that could have been avoided. I wanted to slap him silly by the end of that novel. He does this and then goes full blown werewolf hunter in other instances in this second book. There are a few other characters like this. Not all--he did good with a few. Another thing, why is the full moon happening out of its sequence in normal monthly patterns? He needed to have at least, gave the readers a hint in the second book. Good horror doesn't need to be overly bloody, but it needs the tension building, to erupt close to the end. There is more I can go on about, but hate to spill anymore of the book to readers. But honestly, redo the book, have beta readers or an editor go over it, for this series had great potential.

SKLZ Air Station - Sports Equipment Dryer System;B00H4UP748;[0, 0];3.0;Once all the plastic pieces were out of their boxes, it took 5-10 minutes to assemble this drying tower, an easy assembly. It is attractive, reasonably sturdy, and lightweight. It uses an included AC adapter, economical to run, using only 24 watts. While it is designed for drying sports equipment after their use, it's actually useful for drying many other things. I dried my bathing suit & previously partially pre-dried pool towel which took over 1 1/2 hours. I'm sure pool slippers could be dried as well. It blows out cool, not heated, air from an internal fan. Its drying power is limited. Even the specs claim it will speed up drying by (only) 25%. Though I like it and find it useful, it is W-A-Y overpriced at $200. It is, after all, over 90% plastic.  I can see it would reduce the need for drying items overnight.;01 24, 2014;A2XU6J41ZQOJ2V;Gary in Sun City, AZ;Cool (not heated) tower drying, attractive, sturdy, uses little power, but way overpriced at $200.;1390521600

"Arm &amp; Hammer Clump &amp; Seal Clumping Litter, 14-Pound, Fresh Home";B00H8MDKBE;[0, 0];3.0;This is okay clumping liter.  It has a scent, but it doesn't smell like a urinal mint or whatever other ungodly odorifics most cat litters get doused with.  The litter is the consistency of beach sand, and there is some dust, but not as much as you get with some clay clumping litters.Performance is just okay.  It clumps fairly tight, but the clumps will break apart between the part where you scoop them up and the dumping of the scoop into whatever receptacle you are using.  It also tracks quite a bit.  Smell hasn't been a problem, and the litter is lasting as well as the Dr. Elsey Ultra clumping litter I usually use.Bottom line is that this is okay clumping litter without any kind of overpowering scent.  It's not anything very special or life changing.For reference purposes, I have two male cats, one of whom is diabetic (he's only really wet when he is sick and is drinking and urinating normal amounts as of this writing).  I use three litter boxes, each of which gets scooped as close to immediately as possible (meaning if I see or hear them in the box, right away - otherwise, if I walk to that side of the house and the litter is disturbed i take care of it).

It's just so fascinating to think that this was actually somebody's life!I was originally a bit apprehensive about this movie because I knew Jonah Hill would be in it (another reason I felt Martin must be losing it!) and I am by no means a Jonah Hill fan. However, I was really surprised to find that I not only liked his performance, but his &#34;Donny&#34; was getting a good portion of all the laughs!I was never a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio either, for that matter, but his performance in this movie was outstanding. After seeing this (as well as his performance as Calvin Candy in &#34;Django Unchained&#34;) I have had a much different appreciation for the man and his talents.I'm not giving this the full 5 stars because there were a few flaws in my opinion. First, I didn't care very much for the music. Some of the songs were good choices, that added some fun to the scene, but a lot of others fell flat for me, or even seemed out of place and time. Secondly, I don't care for CGI, which is used in a few scenes (mainly involving the yacht and the helicopter). And thirdly, I wish it was longer, if you can believe that!I just didn't want the fun to end!I would DEFINITELY recommend this movie to anyone who might enjoy, and who can handle, some naughty, over-the-top, adult fun!";05 16, 2014;A3FWZKC4YGX9MS;J.

;B00HAS4FY2;[2, 3];5.0;Of late I have been on a nostalgia kick, playing Steve Jackson based Android games such asSorcery!andFighting Fantasy: Starship Traveller.  I happened across OVERLIVE in the related games section, and intrigued by the description, I took a chance and bought it.  And I am extremely pleased I did!Only one set of permissions, Network Viewing and Access: the game does incorporate optional Twitter access to the developer team and a single Rate Us link, all via the main menu.  Once in the game, there are no obtrusive pushes, leaving you alone (literally amd figuratively) in a world of survival, battles, and hard moral choices that give rise to genuine replay enjoyment.A lifelong RPG fan and strong advocate of pick-a-path books as enticing methods of engaging reluctant readers, FireRabbit has flawlessly pushed the hybrid genre forward into the hands of a new generation. Evocative soundtracks, graphics, and textual descriptions with a myriad of beloved role playing elements, I find myself in the rare experience of desperately hoping the developers continue this fantastic format, of course with even more embellishments and crunchy bits.  The battles are in pseudo real time, giving just that right touch of action, refreshingly propelling the game flow.  The rest is presented in turn-based choices with short but rich writing,  surprises dotting the landscape, seamlessly integrating a character GUI that actually adds to the atmosphere!If you are an old time genre lover like me or an intrepid explorer of new gaming venues, you won't go wrong with OVERLIVE.  I can't believe I am saying this, but this game even beats out the various Steve Jackson games I have recently played.  o.o;05 24, 2014;A202CZ4PJH83G4;Tinfoot;Phenomenal RPG Melding of Text and Action;1400889600

Hype Stereo Clip Mini Bluetooth Speaker Extremely Portable with Mic for iPhone 5s and All Android Phones - Retail Packaging - Grey;B00HE61TXK;[0, 0];5.0;This is a new level of fun!  Especially if you have a bike!Gone are the days where you get in a day of sunshine silently...You can hit your bluetooth button on your smartphone or MP3 player and sync...after that, no wires are needed to play your songs or even answer your calls!  You can adjust the volume and forward etc. by the controls on the tiny speaker and you can even hook in earphones or play directly from the speaker.  That means, without the speaker being tethered to your ipod, you can enjoy music anywhere.I hooked this onto my bike basket when I recently did a lake ride on my bike.  To the beat of my favorite tunes, I actually got into the groove and my speed was twice as fast and I went twice as long as usual!  No need for earphones, it felt like I was in a convertible with the top down, just riding my bike on a quiet Sunday morning with some fun songs.This would make yard work twice as fantastic--use it as a phone as you use your arms to do the work, and in between chats, enjoy your tunes, no wires, and the music goes where you move because it's clipped onto your shirt or tool belt or whatever you wish.  So clear tunes and ability to skip songs and forward as desired right from the box!This is one of those things you don't know you need until you have one and adore once you get it.  Because of that, it's a really economical gift for anyone old enough to have an MP3 player or smart phone.  Young to old, you'll find lots of uses.A fun little gadget!Speaker provided by HypeReview is my unbiased opinion.;02 19, 2014;A17V9XL4CWTQ6G;Chandler;"Wirelessly plays your itunes; clips onto your bike basket or jacket or treadmill, or backpack or anything!";1392768000

Outre Quick Weave Half Wig - MAXINE (1 Jet Black);B00HJC3GMG;[1, 1];3.0;"The hair itself was pretty - soft texture, nice long spiral waves; the color matched my own hair perfectly, but! it is made in two very distinct layers, the lower half of the piece noticeably thinner than the top half, and not a gradual thinning as you might expect, but almost like a stair step midway down.  Not sure if this is a quality control issue and just the one I received, but I was extremely disappointed.  Moreover, the whole piece is thinner than even one side of that shown in the picture and the only way to fix it would be to cut it up to the top layer, losing half its length.  Bought from another site, not thru Amazon.  Not returnable.  Not happy.  UPDATE:  I had ordered two of these and after my disappointment with the first, threw them both in a box and only recently opened the second one.  It has much better thickness throughout the piece, the same soft, gorgeous waves, texture and length, though it is a slightly different, more auburn shade than the first and so is less of a match for my own hair; neither comes up to the expectations of thickness raised by the picture.  Same brand, same shade, same style, same supplier, and these two pieces couldn't be more different. Awarding one more star for the nicer second piece, but withholding one for inconsistent product manufacture - not a vendor's fault as I presume they receive them already boxed; still, it shouldn't be so much of a risk with a brand name.";04 21, 2014;A04593672CKRES7DU7ARG;Valentine;Not happy and update;1398038400

Dyson DC65 Multi Floor Upright Vacuum Cleaner;B00HNUFIBQ;[0, 0];5.0;"I've had a Dyson DC 07 for ~11 years now which recently developed a crack in the plastic clutch housing. I thought that it would be a good time to upgrade considering that I've gotten many years of dependable use from it. I decided on the DC65 Multi Floor version since it is exactly the same vacuum as the Animal and Animal Complete, just with fewer attachments and a considerably lower price tag. (Note: You can purchase the Animal tangle free tool for this vacuum and still come out of pocket considerably less than buying the Animal &#34;package&#34;)I have to say that the upgrade was definitely worth the investment in every way. Not only is the suction noticeably stronger (feels like it's at least 2X the 07 model), but the beater bar does an awesome job of actually getting down into the fibers of the carpet to kick up dirt/dust vs. brushing across the top of them.I did the typical vacuum comparison of using the older DC07 model followed by the DC65 model in the same areas and was really surprised at the results. The 07 actually did a good job of grabbing the dog hair off the surface, but the 65 pulled up a surprising amount of dirt and dust from the carpet. Actually enough to fill the canister half way!The other major improvements that the DC65 has over the DC07 are the ball steering and the low profile head design. The ball takes one or two times of vacuuming to get used to, but you learn to really love the flexibility of it. I like being able to make a 90 degree turn around objects without having to pull the vacuum back and square up. Regarding the low profile of the DC65, I never put much thought in the limitations that the DC07 had. Instead of vacuuming around beds, couches and other pieces of furniture with the DC07, the DC65 actually gets under them a few inches. You'd be surprised how much &#34;stuff&#34; accumulates in this small area!Having a six month old baby at the house that is starting to crawl and a full grown black lab that lives indoors, I couldn't be more happy with this vacuum. I would definitely recommend this vacuum to anyone out there.";05 19, 2014;AM279VWXJ431F;Jeremy;DC 07 vs DC 65  ....... DC 65 Wins Hands Down!;1400457600

This book is everything you could want in a story. This one will have you laughing one second and crying the next so make sure you don't have to go to the bathroom while reading and have the tissues handy!Julie - oh my goodness Julie.  I love her.  I wish she were a real person just so I could befriend her.  This girl is HILARIOUS!  She's clumsy, has no filter - she says whatever comes to mind, and is just all around goofy.Leo - oh Leo.  I love him.  I'm not gonna lie.  He is just...yep, I'm at a loss.The chemistry between these two is just off the charts.  Their quirky ways of teasing one another has to be one of my favorite things.  I immediately felt so drawn to them that again, I wished they were real people.The ending will leave you in tears - that I promise you.This book is perfect.  There is nothing else I can say.

;B00HX0XOBW;[1, 9];3.0;"Demon Hunter is one of the longest-running metalcore bands in the business. Most of the ones out there, if they're lucky, do three or four albums and enjoy moderate success. Then they either fizzle out of the scene or just call it quits for no reason. But Demon Hunter? They've been doing this since 2002. This is their seventh album. That's pretty amazing.Demon Hunter has always been an up-and-down band. They've had some masterpiece albums (The World Is A Thorn, The Triptych, True Defiance), and they've also had a couple of weak albums (Summer of Darkness), or in the case of Storm the Gates Of Hell, just flat out terrible. So where does Extremist fall?Well... I guess we had to expect that after two albums that contained their heaviest material ever, we should've come to expect a more experimental album. But that's what we get here--one of their most diverse releases ever. Much like Summer of Darkness, things are a mixed bag. Some songs are brilliant (""Death,"" ""The Last One Alive,"" ""Beyond Me""), some songs are just okay (""Artificial Light,"" ""What I'm Not,"" ""One Last Song"") and some just flat out terrible songs (""I Will Fail You,"" ""Hell Don't Need Me,"" ""The Heart of a Graveyard"").Demon Hunter normally has only two ballads on an album. But there are a *lot* more here. And the moments are heavy, tend to be rather inconsistent. ""One Last Song"" is a perfect example--it has some good guitar work, and an excellent bridge--but a shockingly bland chorus. And the singles? Well, ""The Last One Alive"" is an album highlight--it's your typical great Demon Hunter radio single. But ""Artificial Light,"" although it's good, just doesn't live up to other lead singles, like ""Collapsing,"" ""My Destiny,"" ""Infected,"" or even ""Not Ready to Die."" Unfortunately, there's not much else they could've gone with, because can you imagine the short-but-sweet ""Death"" with its Latin chant early on being a single? ""Beyond Me"" could've worked, but still. And as for ""I Will Fail You,"" it lives up to its title, because it is an epic fail indeed. I mean... why? What were they thinking?People may think you're bipolar if you are listening to this album with headphones. Because one moment you may be rocking out, and the next you may have a disgusted expression on your face. But that's what this album does--it polarizes you as you're listening to it. It polarizes itself, if you will.Now, I'm not Demon Hunter, but I certainly wouldn't be saying that ""this is the album we're most proud of."" Still, though, it's certainly not the worst thing they've ever done.";03 20, 2014;A1DWNZ699ESGHO;;Not their worst, but far from their best;1395273600

;B00HZOBBM0;[1, 2];3.0;I would have to say I agree with the reviewers who are saying the loss of Steve Howe is obvious and this sounds like a Wetton-Downes album.  I have been following Asia since the early 80's and the same thing happened on Astra.  Neither Gravitas nor Astra are bad albums in fact by normal standards they are quite good.  However by Asia standards they both suffer in complexity and in overall completeness when compared to the albums Steve Howe contributed to.  His guitar work is one of things that create the signature Asia sound and quite frankly without it there is just 'something missing' from the songs.  Just the humble opinion of a longtime fan.;07 18, 2014;AOJEVYUMPLO5J;"Douglas H. Graham ""livinginoz77449""";A void has been created...;1405641600
;B00HZOBBM0;[0, 3];4.0;Same old Asia still the same. It's funny in a way that this band doesn't really progress when most of them came from bands that were termed progressive. If you like Asia this album is still in the same vein as Astra, XXX and the Now tracks from Then and Now but with a new guitarist there are moments of a little harder edge. None of the songs on the album are bad but none of them really stick out with greatness. Valkyrie, Gravitas, The Closer I Get To You, and Joe DiMaggio's Glove are the best in my opinion. The DVD is OK but it could have been better. The video Valkyrie is the weakest for video content  (John Wetton on the beach and other members walking around LA.) that could have been made a lot better. The concert in Plovdiv is really good but only 3 songs. Why not the whole concert or a few more tracks? I believe they did at least 10 or 11 other songs from this gig. I always liked Asia throughout their existence as a band and they are still good at what they do but in some ways, personally, I would like to see them be more dynamic musically.

;B00I08WCC8;[5, 5];5.0;There are not a lot of rts type games out there in the traditional pc fashion. however there is something similar in it. The base building and resource gathering are very rts and the combat is pretty close. You want to do this for free and get somewhere in a hurry this is not the game for you. You need patience of a god to do it that way, though if this is just one of many games like this you play on your tab then it can work as you bounce around from one to the next. I have spent like 30 in this game and feel Luke warm of whether it was worth it or not. As far as 30 bucks for a game in the measure of graphics and immersion depth and complexity.. then no it was not worth is. In term of entertainment value over the last month.. then yes it was very worth it. This like many free to play are made to be addicting and short circuit your rational thrifty defenses, and it does a great job at that. The multiplayer aspect is maybe the best part. You are paired to only be attacked or attack like strengthened players so it keeps it fair, unlike games similar to this like colony attack where you can get your fleet of a month's worth of hard work and resources carefully spent wiped out at a moment's notice by a mega player 1000 times your strength. There is a vibrant ingame chat going on and alliances are easy to join and take part in resource sharing as well as help beat 'epic' maps together for gold. Also the single player campaign for racking up resources and bonus items is a well done and varied as well as rewards for completing certain milestones as you progress through the game  All in all this is a well thought out and highly addicting game which I recommend.;05 10, 2014;A3U11U0YBIIRS;David M.

There are songs that bring tears to the eyes, songs that make you dance, and instrumentals that are a new take on beautiful classics such that the instrumental (Amazing Grace) becomes more powerful and heartfelt than ever before.

"Waggin' Train Jerky Duos Dog Treats, Made with Real Chicken &amp; Sweet Potatoes";B00I18UVSO;[0, 0];4.0;It's tough to review a food product you cannot eat.  I could say that the dog gets excited when I open the package, but the rabbit gets excited when I open the package (she loves pretzel shaped treats and knows she gets a treat when the dog does).  Still, the dog is very happy with them.  There are about two dozen in the package. The packaging is convenient, and the treats aren't greasy or anything else which makes them unpleasant to hand out.  Chicken is first on the ingredient list, which is good, though honestly I don't see the attraction of sweet potatoes as a pet food.  Still, there's nothing wrong with it and it's better than many things which might pad out a meat product.All in all a nice treat for your dog.;05 15, 2014;A1OZ0PGAE70JQI;Griswel;Good (I assume);1400112000

One of the simplest ways I found to save money is to find free activities to do for fun, that don't require a cover charge, or going out for expensive meals or buying pricey drinks.We all need a little reminder now and then about how to make a dollar stretch farther, and this book is a great start for anyone who has a limited budget to work with.;03 14, 2014;A3VCH5J8LUFYTK;Jewels133;Common Sense Ideas;1394755200

Archer Farms Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee 12 Ounce Light Roast Coffee;B00IH4FC3Q;[0, 0];5.0;"My family are not what many would consider &#34;coffee drinkers&#34; because we never buy or brew unflavored coffee.  Having said that, we LOVE our flavored coffee & are always trying different flavors from various companies.  To be quite honest, I bought this coffee & a couple more, because they were on sale at a significantly lower price than the other available coffees.  Of course when I got home and my husband & son saw the coffees that I had bought, they were ready for some coffee.  Since our son is a big fan of Vanilla coffees I decided to make this one first.  I put the coffee pot on and it was not long before this amazingly enticing aroma reached everyone and they were asking how soon before it was ready.  I hoped that the taste matched the wonderful aroma.  I prepared the cups (I always put things like sugar and/or creamer) in the cup first so the hot coffee will mix in as I pour it on top.  I poured the coffee into the cups and as I finished pouring each cup it was quickly taken.  Before I even had a chance to put the pot down and get to taste the coffee myself, I started hearing high praises and they were telling me to keep buying this coffee!  Then I tasted it and immediately knew that this was a coffee that ALWAYS had to be on hand!  Very rich, without being strong, very aromatic, without being too sweet.  The sweetness is just right and this coffee is absolutely delicious!  I should mention that we have tried other coffees from this company with equal pleasure!";05 27, 2014;AQ8J3KF45DBYN;Rebecca Magdaleno Rankins;The fragrant aroma draws you in & the taste hooks you!;1401148800

Once Ray get's Zin in his ropes the way the author describes it, makes you wish you can trade places with her. The way Ray uses his ropes its damn near therapeutic and so beautiful.

Jouer Blushing Beauty Palette;B00IJXBE00;[0, 0];4.0;I'm not quite sure what the deal is with makeup kits these days - this is the second product I've gotten that doesn't include applicators, which used to be a feature of every makeup compact I've bought. Truly, are sticks with a wad of cotton that expensive to include?! The most unique thing about this beauty palette is its packaging - each part interlocks with the other, like a puzzle, including the lip gloss.  This is a very clever and space saving design, but why not include the applicator in a box that can be interlocked with the set as well? As a result, if you pack this on a trip, you'll still need to have your makeup in two separate places - one consisting of the palette set and the other, just the applicator.It's too bad, because the palette contains everything you need to make up your face in one small package. The foundation powder feels soft and went on smoothly (using my own brush) and I liked the fact that the eyeshadow, highlighter, tint and gloss are all so shimmery. However, I'm not sure I would pay over $50 for this - I like quality makeup, but there was nothing outstanding that would make me want to choose this brand over, say, Benefit or MAC cosmetics. The amount of eyeshadow, highlighter and tint are also quite small.  So I would buy this on sale but never at the original price.;05 6, 2014;AMB2Z4FMDBWQY;"VIDFAN ""specfellow""";I Would Rate This Higher If Applicators Were Included!;1399334400

Crock-Pot SCCPVI600-S Countdown Slow Cooker with Stove-Top Browning, Stainless Finish, 6-Quart;B00IPENZK0;[0, 0];5.0;I can't say enough good things about this crockpot! I've owned several before (both Crock-Pot brand and other slow cookers), and they all seem to work the same. What sets this one apart is the ability to brown your meat on the stove IN THE POT. I know that browning the meat first makes it taste better, but I'm often too lazy to do it--I have to dirty another pan, transfer the meat, etc. But with this, I just put the meat in the crockpot with a little oil, brown it on the stove, and then move it into the base. So easy! I also really like the countdown feature. Once the programmed cooking time is finished, it shifts into warm mode, keeping my food warm until I'm ready for it but keeping it from getting too mushy and overdone. The crockpot itself is very light, and it goes in the dishwasher, so cleanup is a breeze!;06 19, 2014;A2GK5S3ZF9Y8YO;ChristianChick'sThoughts;The perfect crockpot for me!;1403136000
;B00IPQ23JC;[1, 1];5.0;"What did you do to my Grant Blue?!?!&#34;Obsessive&#34; by Isobel Irons is book two of her Issues series and picks up not to long after &#34;Promiscuous&#34; left off. Unlike the last story which is told entirely from Tash's POV, this one is told by her Mr. Perfect, Grant Blue.&#34;I'm not perfect. I'm a walking malfunction. And more than anything, I'm scared. All the time. I'm scared to let Tash find out just how perfect I'm not, because then something bad will happen.&#34; -GrantI knew from reading book one of this series there was more to Grant than Tash realized and even towards the end when he admitted to having OCD (obsessive compulsion disorder) I still wasn't sure just how bad it would be. Let's just say that in this book, Grant struggles and struggles until he just can't anymore. My heart literally broke over and over again every time he tried to break his compulsions and rituals. And it wasn't just that my heart broke because he fought it so hard, it was because he punished himself. &#34;I'm not even sure if I'll ever be able to live away from home, or go to school, or hold down a job, or get married. Or anything normal people are supposed to grow up and do. Because I'm never going to be able to stop thinking about all the bad things that might happen if I try.&#34; He truly believed that if he didn't do something then it would cause harm to those he loved. Ugh! Just writing that makes my heart break again!!I loved the character growth in this book for Grant. We see at the beginning a boy who's only wish is to be normal and he grows to a man who can accept his disorder for what it is. Beautifully written and very realistic. I empathized with Grant so much. As I read I felt like I was living in his shoes for just a brief moment and how hard it was for him to always be &#34;Mr. Perfect&#34;, not just for Tash but his parents, his sisters, and everyone around him.I loved the relationship dynamics in this book as well. Tash's insecurities are still present, but we get a chance to see Grant's as well. Their relationship grows in this book and I just can't get enough of either of them (Please tell me there's going to be more from these two!) I also loved Gen, Grant's baby sister. She has such a hero-worship going on with her big brother that it's adorable!Hats off to Miss Irons for once again hooking me into a plot! I read this book in one sitting, unable to tear myself away for any reason. Watching Grant as he literally hits rock bottom was an emotional roller coaster for me. If you enjoy realistic, coming-of-age stories then please do yourself a favor and pick up this book/series. You will not be disappointed!

This book in the series could be listed as both a mystery and romance novel as both genres are perfectly woven together in this cozy mystery.  The family element in this series is a welcome addition in a world where a dysfunctional environment is sensationalized, and those tight-knit families that still exist are rarely mentioned.  Just like every family, very member of Sam's Darling's family have their own unique quirks and problems which makes the characters not only believable, but real.Looking forward to reading ""Will You Marry Me?"" that I've read is the next in the series.Recommended to everyone who enjoys a cozy mystery series with a little meat stirred into the pot.";07 5, 2014;APMX2DC7FD4Y4;"Kimberly Shursen ""Kimberly Shursen- author""";And Sam Darling continues ...;1404518400

;B00IQOFTEE;[0, 0];4.0;"**Review courtesy of All Things Urban Fantasy**SEX & THE SINGLE VAMP had all the aspects of a vampire romance I like. Pairing of vampires of similar ages? Check! Centuries of sexual tension resolving itself? Check! A smoking hot hero and a heroine who isn&#8217;t afraid to stand her ground? Check and check again! The perfect little evening read, SEX & THE SINGLE VAMP is cute, tense, and sexy, and definitely worth a look.For its short length, I wasn&#8217;t expecting tons from SEX & THE SINGLE VAMP. I got way more than I expected. I appreciated that the hero and heroine had a huge backstory, and there wasn&#8217;t any instalove between a centuries old vampire and a mortal woman (okay, maybe there was, but it took place way before the story started, so I&#8217;m giving it a pass). Cici and Deacon had a long time to tango with each other, and hearing about their past and their tiptoeing around each other was refreshing. It isn&#8217;t often that a relationship like that develops in paranormal romance, so I loved it. There was some great dialogue, as well. Conversations between Deacon and Andy, his second in command, were funny, and the sexual tension between Deacon and Cici was delightfully hot.My one complaint would be the easiness with which the conflict was resolved. Obviously, the length of the book puts some limitations on how in-depth you can go, but there was a bit of magic mojo and then, boom! Happily ever after. A little too coincidental for me. Also, the description makes the book seem a tad bit more playful than it actually is. I would almost say it dips into the romantic suspense arena, with murderers running amok and somebody going after Cici.All in all, however, SEX & THE SINGLE VAMP was fun, witty, sexy and refreshing. I wouldn&#8217;t mind re-visiting this world and seeing some of the other characters get their happily ever afters (Andy and Mya anyone??).";03 27, 2014;A1RMS2HHSYPH3;Kate;Hot, witty and tons of fun;1395878400
;B00IQOFTEE;[0, 0];5.0;"Sex and the Single Vamp.........Robin CovingtonWhat would our world be like with Vampires and Shapeshifters living together in Washington D.C.?  Ms. Covington brings us up close and personal with a matchmaking agency being focused on by a hate group, and the head of a security agency who has been in love with our heroine  for two hundred and forty years!  Did I get your attention?Felicity Trent, known as Cici, has been a vampire since 1775. In Williamsburg, Virginia her family was massacred and left to die. She was saved by an unknown person, who brought her into the vampire life, and left her with someone to take care of her, and teach her the ways.  In present day D.C. Cici runs a very popular matchmaking agency called Your Better Half.  She is widely seen on talk shows, and the Internet, to boost the popularity of her business. It is controversial because many feel that humans and &#34;others&#34; should not mingle.  Your Better Half has had four clients murdered, and the police are looking at Ceci as a person of interest. She needs help, and only one person has that ability.Thomas Samuel Deacon was in Williamsburg, and a close friend of Cici's father. It actually was Josiah, as he lay dying who begged Thomas to save his daughter.  Reluctantly, he did, and left her with someone he trusted. He was in love with her then, despite the feeling she had rejected him, and is very much in love with her now.  His business is known as Aura Mortis Security, and Deacon's second in command and best friend is Andy Silverfox, American Indian and were shapeshifter. Cici and Deacon have not seen each other since 1943, when they both worked as spies for the U.S. He has been covertly keeping an eye on her every move since then.  He's not surprised when he sees her in his office. He does not believe humans and others should be mated. Humans age and die, immortals do not, loss and heartbreak follow.  He does agree that she needs help and someone to protect her. He doesn't want her money though. He proposes one night in his bed, and they can move on with their eternal lives. At least he hopes one night will do.  Cici agrees with one stipulation. He has to find her Maker.This is a suspenseful story, lots of twists, and even includes a few gasps!  My imagination was totally stirred thinking of life with vampires, shapeshifters, supernaturals and humans living side by side. Of course, there is a hate group bent on destruction to add to the story.I have read and enjoyed all of Ms. Covington's contemporary romances. This is a different path for her but equally enjoyable.  Her voice is entertaining, as are her characters.  Highly recommend this novel, especially if you enjoy immortals.I received this novel from the publisher for an honest review.Pat Fordyce";03 24, 2014;AYIPGMUURK82V;Pat Fordyce;Vampires anyone?;1395619200

MIO Link Continuous Strapless Heart Rate Wrist Band;B00IVF04LG;[0, 0];2.0;I have had a Mio Link for about two weeks now and am in the process of returning it to Best Buy and getting a refund. It is extremely inaccurate and constantly disconnects from my phone. I will have it basically on top of my Galaxy S3 and it will drop connection. I thought it was the case I had on it so I removed that from the equation and it was just as bad. The Mio GO and MapMyFitness apps will show varying readings and sometimes be off as much as 20BPM.I have tried to wear it so the sensor was on the underpart of my wrist and it made no difference. Some posts stated it has to be worn about an inch higher than where you'd think you'd have to wear it. That makes it very uncomfortable and doesn't improve accuracy. Switching wrists doesn't do squat either. Also with MapMyFitness I have to click CONNECT a half dozen times before it magically sees it and pairs it properly. Overall it is making my workout a challenge and not in a good way.My wife bought one the same time as me and had the same problems and tried all of the same things I did to improve it to no avail.

"Saicoo&trade; Natural Light 10W LED Eye-protection Multi-function Desk Lamp with aluminum alloy light head, 3 Lighting Modes- Studying, Reading and Relaxation / Bedtime, 5- Level Brightness Control for each mode";B00IZAHJ88;[1, 1];5.0;I just received this desk lamp, so I hope this review is not premature.  This lamp is very well thought out in it's design and functionality.  I really wish more companies would put as much thought into their products.First, it was super easy to assemble.  The lamp as several swivel, folding options making it very adaptable to any desk layout.Second, it has a very attractive modern look to it.  The touch controls are perfectly placed at the base of the lamp and are responsive thus far.Third, and most importantly, the lamp is very bright.  Also the ability to changed the light color is extremly handy.  This option should put most fluorescent/cfl lamps out of contention as well as standard incandescent lamps.  The fluorescent lights in my office have definitely caused my eye sight to deteriorate since I have worked here.  I have actually removed the bulbs from the lights directly over head and started using a desk lamp.  However, it was not functionaly beneficial therefore I purchased this product.So, thus far I am very please with this product.  The price perhaps could be less for a small desk lamp, but I am ok with it.;06 2, 2014;A16RIPUCYXFAQ6;Jason N.;Perfect option for my desk;1401667200

I like the different light adjustment levels and different spectrums. I use the cool light setting at the brightest setting for my eyes. The only thing I would like different for piano use, is have the top lamp mounted in a Tee configuration, for better coverage over the two pages of music and not stick out so far in front of the music and over the key board. Other than that for my use, it does exactly what is described and I have not found any with these features close to this price level.;06 26, 2014;A2AJDJXM1HDV9J;missisiptom;Piano light;1403740800

;B00J1WU41S;[0, 0];5.0;"Where do I even start?  It has taken me a few days to gather my thoughts so I can even begin to write about how much I LOVED THIS STORY!  I was captivated from the first chapter and never wanted it to end.  I could personally connect with this story and that made it that much more intense.  I devoured this book and finished it in one day, I just couldn't get enough!  Allie has written a beautiful story and I am in love with True North!Olivia (Livie) has always liked Jake.  They have always been around each other since her older brother Nate, is Jake's best friend.  And her best friend, Jules, is Jake's sister.  But this isn't your typical in love with your brother's friend story.  Because what everyone doesn't know is that Livie and Jake share a deep connection.  They always have.  But as much as Jake doesn't want to leave Livie, he feels like he has to.  He just hopes she will still be here waiting for him.""I hate leaving you, Livie, but this is something I need to do for too many reasons.""  ~Jake""Remember what it means.  My heart has always belonged to you.  Think about me, Liv, and don't say goodbye.""  ~JakeNo more than a year after Jake left, he quit writing Livie.  She was heartbroken and years later she is still but that is masked by anger.  Although that is about to change now, because Jake North, the town hero, has returned home after 4 long years.  Once she sees him, every old feeling she had comes flooding back.  But she wants him to see that she has grown up.  What she didn't plan for was for Jake to be so lost.""Oh, Liv...if there was a way I could earn a place in your heart,""  he pleaded.  ""You're already in my heart,"" I promised.  ""You make me remember who I was and who I wanted to be.""  His mouth warmed my ear, tender but sensual.  ""Live, I lost that guy.""  ""Let me help you find him.""War has a way of changing people.  And Jake has lost who he used to be.  But one look at Livie and he knows that she is still his everything.  The road to finding himself is not going to be easy though and sometimes along the way you hurt those you love without even realizing it.  PTSD is AWFUL!  The anger, frustrations, nightmares, are terrible.  But the inner turmoil of feeling alone can cause you to push people away without even realizing it.  Jake would never intentionally hurt Livie, but he knows he will so he tries to stay away.  And ends up hurting her anyway.""I was used to being discarded by my mom and dad, but never thought it would happen with Jake.  It shattered me...again.""  ~LivieWhen Jake realizes he can't be away from Livie anymore, she is determined to help him find himself again.  No matter how hard it gets, she will stick by him.""When everything you think about the world and the people in it spins out of control, you have a couple of choices:  run away with your tail tucked between your legs or hang the f*** on.  I chose the latter.""Every step in the right direction is hard, but together they know they can survive anything.  But how much is too much?  Did the war change Jake too much?  And sometimes the disaster that could destroy you is one you never saw coming.""Livie, there's no going back once we cross this line,"" he reminded.  ""I don't want to go back to a world without you.""AHH!  SO GOOD!  This is a must read!  Allie This is the beginning to what promises to be an amazing series of books!  We met a lot of characters during Livie & Jake's story and I can't wait to get to know them each better!  Start reading this book TODAY!  You won't be disappointed!  Beautiful Story!""Tell me you're mine, Livie.""  ""I'm yours, Jake.  Forever.  I'm yours.""**Gifted a copy for a Honest Review**";04 2, 2014;A129GOUKQHVKM9;A.

;B00J1WU41S;[1, 3];2.0;Like many books I've read recently, it starts out strong but struggles through the middle and ends with a whimper. Jake and Livie are childhood sweethearts separated when jake joins the military. He stops writing her after a while but when he returns home 4 years later they find that he probably has PTSD but he still has strong feelings for her. The rest of the book just muddles through the romance part and suffers from the fact that there is no suspense about the romance, or how these two feel about each other. I guess at the end of the day if you like the idea of a military hero with PTSD and a devoted heroine then you should read it. I was completely bored.;04 17, 2014;A2SCMJOL9Y9Y45;"nara ""gergererg""";dull;1397692800

BACK to the not-so-smart phone with a keyboard and a button to push to answer the call...heaven !  The seller expedited the phone from their company in Canada, arrived in perfect time to my shipper in Florida, a week later it arrived and got it set up by my much smarter husband and now I am happy again.

SKLZ Quickster Chipping Net with Free SKLZ Carry Bag;B00J7GR420;[0, 0];4.0;"I've tried over 20 self-training aids; most are boring but may help with narrow, specific skills.  But this SKLZ chipping net is fun, can be set up wihin a couple of minutes, and then shoot away!  And in order to accurately chip, one learns multiple skills.I also have used a competitor's tri-concentric chipping net, similar to JEF's World of Golf chipping net.  For many psychological reasons that I don't fully understand (e.g. colors, layout) the SKLZ motivates me more.  But, the tri-centric net is far more accurate on scoring, because with SKLZ, the balls can roll or land into SKLZ's scoring pockets, without being legitimately chipped into.  If accurate scoring is an issue (for example, chipping-competing with a friend), other chipping nets may be better.Compared to JEF's, this SKLZ net is more compact, easy to store and carry, and light weight.  Both are wind-resistant and all parts are connected (so can't lose parts).  The above tri-centric net is $10 less.If same price as tri-centric, I would choose SKLZ.  As SKLZ is $10 more, I have to give it a 4 star.  Of all my golf training tools, these chipping nets are the most fun.";06 9, 2014;A9GIGJUB98JNR;"Chen Sun ""WebAndNet.com""";Fun but pricey;1402272000

;B00JALIA3Y;[0, 0];5.0;I've been looking forward to reading this one for awhile!  I'm so glad it's out, and it was definitely worth the wait.  I'm kind of jealous of anyone who can read the whole series in one go now, but the anticipation and excitement was fun for me, too.  What a great series!Broken Bear 3 picks up where the other one left off, and it starts right in the thick of things.  I really enjoyed it, and I loved seeing all of the characters again.  While Owen is healing, Jett goes off to confront Kane, and that's where everything begins.  Daniella's sort of mystery secret was intense, too.  This reads like a shifter romantic thriller in a lot of ways, which was different from a lot of the stories I've read.  I think Bears were a great choice for this, though.  There's definitely a lot of power and intensity there, which was great.The tension and emotional drama were on high alert, too.  This is the climax, and it definitely shows.  There's suspense, romance, and so much more.  The ending was hard won, but I really loved it.  I've been desperately wanting to see how everything turned out, and I was definitely pleased.If you like shifter romance, with a focus on bears, you'll definitely love this.  It's got all the telltale shifter qualities, but with a bit of mystery, thriller, and suspense added in for heightened emotions and romance, too.  Overall just a great story.;04 15, 2014;A1SRF1MQM9J281;"~Cerys ""~Cerys""";Yummy bears;1397520000
;B00JAW4GHM;[1, 1];5.0;"At this stage in his career, Chick's playing is absolutely wondrous. His delight in creating music is evident in this collection of musical &#34;portraits.&#34; While in the past I've sometimes felt that Chick's technical expertise and fluidity became ends in themselves, in this collection he lets his technique serve the music, which at times left me breathless. I especially enjoyed his take on Stevie Wonder's &#34;Pastime Paradise.&#34; In the past few years Chick has been playing The Beatles' &#34;Eleanor Rigby&#34; and it's great to hear him continue to explore pop music here. Also, the piano was recorded with a warm, pleasing sound; a welcome contrast with the tinny sound of Corea's Expressions CD, for example.

I replaced a Yamaha system and the improvement is significant. I especially like the surround sound setup feature, it made a huge difference in my home theater.

When I hooked up the Sony Playstation the audio worked when Game is selected but no video on the component output. I hooked up another TV to the HDMI output and it worked but that does me no good in my home theater! Also any other component or composite inputs are not routed to component outputs, only HDMI.

Sprayable Energy - The Best Energy Supplement;B00JD857XU;[0, 1];5.0;I would buy Sprayable Energy again because sometimes I want that extra pick-me-upper. I am not too keen on energy drinks because of the sugar or sugar alternatives and empty calories. Coffee I can do sometimes but it tends to accelerate bowel movements but I haven't had that experience with Sprayable.Sprayable Energy is amazing! Truly a new frontier in our energy drink over caffeinated, sugar laden lives. With nothing but the pure skin permeating caffeine, Sprayable Energy may be a life saver for most! I've been using it for about a week now and I use about two applications a day, namely before school and after work. I am finding myself more attentive and awake but without any type of jitters or crashes and also the feeling of just downing a large coffee or energy drink is now absent of course.I would recommend everyone to put down that extra cup of coffee, to save your money on energy drinks, and gave sprayable energy a try!;05 1, 2014;A2NOBG53IETPES;Phillip V.

;B00JGHTGHQ;[1, 1];5.0;"Smith is one of those authors who can get the perfect balance of everything in her pages.  She combines southern charm with big city curtness, sweet with sexy, suspense with romance, reality with imagination.  Everything comes together in a story that you won&#8217;t be able to put down.  Smith writes suspense and anxiety with such realism that you can&#8217;t help but feel it seeping from the pages of the book.  Combine this with her down to earth yet extremely picturesque descriptions I feel like I&#8217;d stepped into the South myself.The characters definitely make this novel.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the storyline was phenomenal but the people really make you love them.  Right from the first page the author makes it so easy to understand the main character; her thoughts, her feelings, her actions.  As a reader you&#8217;re able to form a connection with her.  I admire the fact that she&#8217;s willing to go the extra mile to change the things that she isn&#8217;t happy with.  The male lead is a bit of an enigma that you can&#8217;t help but fall for.  He is genuine yet mysterious all at the same time.  He&#8217;s also an alpha male without it being outright apparent & in your face.  Add to this the fantastic supporting cast that make you feel just as welcome as (at least one of) the main characters did and you will feel like this is your new home.Overall this was a fantastic read that I couldn&#8217;t put down for a second.

It looked like it might be worth taking a chance on, so I did.  And I am very glad that I did.This book is not an allegorical fantasy such as the Narnia books, nor is it the preachy sort of book that can only be appreciated if you share a Christian worldview.  (Which I do, as it happens, but I loathe preachy novels!)  It has the sort of applicability that one might find in a series like Lord of the Rings, where the author's world view is implicit rather than overt.  If the reader happens to share that worldview, then that will add a deeper, richer level of enjoyment to the story.  If not, it's still a well-written fantasy story.I liked the author's treatment of the Fae in this novel.  Unlike most fantasy non-humans, Brightley's Fae come across as truly alien despite their human-like appearance.  Forget Tinkerbell; these Fae are more like the sidhe of Celtic folklore.  I loved the interactions and communication struggles stemming from the cultural differences between the Fae and humankind. The story's human protagonist is extremely curious and impetuous--two traits which quickly land her in trouble.  Some of her actions pushed at the boundaries of believability for me, but didn't quite cross over the line.  (I live with two ADHD teens who have been known to act before thinking, or even give decisions a little forethought but act impulsively anyway, so that might be why.)  The society is  unsettling; I am old enough to realize how mutable memories can be, and how even supposedly well-known &#34;facts&#34; can seemingly change over time depending on a society's collectively shifting point of view.  The magic in this story feels inherent to the story world.  It's not &#34;bippity boppety boo&#34; magic, nor is it drawn from an outside source, but it's part of the natural laws of that world.The end of the novel sets the stage for a sequel.  I hope that's a promise that will be delivered on soon.";05 15, 2014;A1OQ3XCN2B4HTY;Evie Delacourt;Enjoyable, often thought-provoking read;1400112000

;B00JOPR0ZK;[2, 3];5.0;I've said this many times in my reviews, but I honestly always try to stay away from novellas. They always feel so rushed that you cant fully get into the story. I am happy to say that is NOT the case with Happenstance!! But then again, I already knew it would be amazing because everything that Jamie McGuire writes is perfection. Happenstance is an emotional story about finding out who you are, where you belong, and who you want you by your side through it all.Happenstance is the beginning of a series of novellas and boy does it kick it off right!! I absolutely adored Erin Easter. She has been given a tough life but she hasn't let it destroy her. She is so smart and strong and I just wanted to reach inside the book and hug her so many times while reading. Weston was just as amazing. I loved him for so many reasons, but mainly because he protected Erin fiercely. He is thoughtful and caring and just such a genuinely good person and that makes you fall in love with him instantly. Erin and Weston are perfect together because they balance each other out so well. They push each other to go for what they want and they support each other through the difficult times. And boy oh boy are there some difficult times. I won't say more as to not give anything away, but just know that there are some serious shockers that you never see coming, and some really amazing and sweet moments as well. The road that Erin and Weston are traveling on is a bumpy and winding road, but as long as they travel it together, I know they will make it out alright. I also love that we got a sneak peak of Beautiful Oblivion!! I absolutely cannot wait for that as well as the next installment of this series!!Happenstance is a story that many people will relate to in one way or another, which is just another of Jamie's many writing talents. It is a story of struggle and fear, of hope and depression, of loss and of love. But mostly, it is a story about finding who you truly are, where you truly belong, and who truly loves you for you. If you are considering reading this book, JUST DO IT, you will not be disappointed!!Ps. My review name should be Kellee, not Amazon Customer.

I enjoyed reading about the development of the soft, sheltered boy into a seasoned man and how his experiences with various personalities (both female and male) created this distinct path in his life. The parallel story of Silvio and his horrible actions created a fantastic contrast with Monroe, and the sexual exploits added color to the overall story (even if I was a bit embarrassed to read some of them).

She had survived her senior year, and she was ready to face college in a new place. She was ready to start fresh. All she has to do was to be focused like she has on the previous year and concentrate on her first and only love &#8211; Astronomy.But on her first day, she collided with the cocky, sexy and tattoo-clad bad boy Brax Jenkins, and it was just the beginning. He was quick-tempered, with an accent to fall for. But Olivia has to be careful as he had been rumored to change his girls more than he changes his clothes.He was chosen to do the annual dare his fraternity has this year, and what needed to do was to take Olivia&#8217;s virginity. What wasn&#8217;t on the plan though was to fall in love with the sweet girl from Texas who doesn&#8217;t believe the rumor about him and has given him the benefit of the doubt.But their almost-perfect relationship will crumble into pieces as her past surfaces and threatens not only to chase her happiness away but destroy their newfound relationship too!I love Olivia, but one thing I didn&#8217;t like about her was her secrets, and her insistent to keep a lie to keep her past buried behind her.I wish she&#8217;d tell him. He cared about her that much and he wouldn&#8217;t judge. But she still didn&#8217;t. She continues to wear the ring, perhaps as a shield from any unwanted advantage or from future heartaches. As for Brax, I adore his loving side, but the fast-tempered, violent side of him had me scared. I wanted to ask Olivia if she's sure!But when he goes all protective, and really, really sweet he can melt anyone&#8217;s heart! First, though, he needed to tell Olivia his secret.It&#8217;s not only Olivia you will love, but there&#8217;s her sweet old man, Jilly. He can be tough, but he&#8217;s really sweet, and I love the words he said to his granddaughter. A little reminder that whatever happened in the past, she was still worth it.The only boy good enough for you darlin&#8217; is one who&#8217;d sacrificed everything to have you. I&#8217;m talking about everything important to him, just to keep you. No matter the cost. Otherwise, he ain&#8217;t worth his weight, pound for pound, in pure solid horses***.Secrets, lies, and deception &#8211; Stupid Girl was a great novel I didn&#8217;t expect to love. It may have started out a little slow for me, but as the story progressed, I couldn&#8217;t help but got hooked with Olivia and Brax. I watched them fall in love, felt their hearts broken, and even when I was nearing the end of the novel, I was crossing my fingers on the fear that this will have a cliff-hanger ending on how the things are going, good thing it didn&#8217;t.

So, I decided to go rouge and get this water bottle.  I cut up some pineapple (what I happened to have on hand) into little pieces, stuck them in the tube, filled the bottle with sparkling water and stuck it in the fridge to marinate for a little while.  Now, here is my word of caution...when coming back to your sparkling water with the lid tightly on, probably not the best idea to swirl the water around the fruit infuser vigorously.  I kinda forgot about the &#34;sparkling&#34; part of the water, so, as you can imagine, I had a little bit of a surprise carbonation explosion when I opened it.  Oops!

;B00K00DTJY;[11, 11];5.0;A great source of information for those new to self publishing. As it says in the description, most of the information included can be found free on the Internet. If you have the extra time to go searching for the information, more power to you. I'd rather use that time to write.Everything you need to know about self publishing is right here, from planning your book to how to promote it once its been published. The information that is included on formatting is golden--just that chapter is worth the price of the book. There are some advanced techniques on formatting that I haven't seen, and I'm looking forward to trying some of them out with my next book.I also loved the honesty in the chapter on promotion. Derek doesn't pull punches--it's hard to promote a new book, particularly if you're a new author with no platform. He's got some great ideas of how to get the word out about your book, a few free (which is the point of the book, right?), but many paid. I did like the list of the '10 Most Powerful Things You Can Do For Free,' but the main focus of the promotion part of the book was on paid methods. I also really loved the section at the end where the experienced writers provided their top tips for other authors.I've purchased a lot of books about self publishing.

Motorola Moto E - US GSM - Unlocked - 4GB (Black);B00K0NRVNG;[5, 8];4.0;First of all, this is a really cheap phone for the features it has. It's pretty fast, feels pretty sturdy but you can't expect a high-end phone for the price. It definitely meets my requirements as I'm not that much of a smartphone fan. I'd say that if you're a person who has a phone just for calling and a few apps it's definitely fine. However, don't misunderstand my review, it does a lot of other things and it does them pretty fine. However, if you are planning on getting this for gaming or taking pics this isn't the phone for you.PROS:-Feels well built in your hand.-Cheap-Fast-Up-to-date software-Responsive TouchscreenCONS:-A bit heavy-The camera sucks-Internal storage is really limited (despite the version you choose)Would I recommend it?

This is the darkest book I've ever read, nothing even comes close. That Which Destroys Me makes me want to read more like it. Pretty awesome story that I couldn't look away from.It starts off with so much cussing it like the author is just  daring you to keep reading. I say that because while it continues,  its not as excessive farther in. This is coming from someone that cusses ALL THE TIME lol. Anyways, that was the one of two small things I didn't like in this book.The sex is hot, especially one scene, holly hell. Stella's story is brutal but the future looks hopeful...then it turns. All I can say is wow. Just. Freaking. WOW. The other small thing I didn't care for was towards the end.

A male lead that isn't all cocky and sure of himself is a rare find. His feelings for Mia are intense and beautiful I really liked how he falls in sync with her in the beginning. His reasons in the beginning for them not to start a relationship are valid and heart warming and I loved seeing this side of him. His upbringing is an interesting one and shaped him into the person he is.Mia is one of a kind she has the whole cool geek chic down and some sassy thrown in for good measure. Her innocence in relation to Kye is cute and make her all the more appealing to Kye. I loved her fire especially in her comebacks to Kye and calling him on his bullcarp.I loved how even though they were lovers they were still building a friendship just had some benefits. I love how they grow together as a couple and Kye's revelations on his Tennis career and his life in general are great and I love how he reaches his conclusions.Even though the story was quick I felt there was so much told a well rounded story no questions left open and left you with that satisfied feeling you get after a good storyNicola Marsh's witty one liners (PTSD &#8211; is freaking hilarious yeah its not post traumatic stress &#8211; read it to find out) and hilarious characters bring about a great start to a new series looking forward to Dani's (Mia's BFF)story next.All up a great story, with some hot sexy scenes (the one in the Car holy hotness) and great characters and an Aussie Male lead!!!!!

;B00KZ6DHZO;[1, 1];4.0;This was a good biker book and the second book I have read by this author.Both Karen and Taz were characters in very different stages of their lives.  With Karen's dramas in involving her ex-fiance and Taz leading a life dedicated to his club and club whores, you never get the feeling that this was a perfect match.This authors work is very easy to read and she has created a town which is very likable, but I really did not like Taz and what he stood for.  His job within the club was worse than the enforcers and he never showed any remorse or distaste with what he had to do.  This did take a little away from any connection I felt towards him.I enjoyed this book and I would like to read more from this author.;06 18, 2014;A17KGW8IYD63JR;Stacey*FamilyKindleCoffeLover*;The devil inside;1403049600

;B00L4DXKEU;[0, 0];2.0;Radio Free Albermuth tries to creatively and intellectually tackle too many scientific, pseudo-scientific, and spiritual theories and ideas, from the profound weight of which, it collapses upon itself like a bloated, gaseous neutron star. The dialogue offers some interesting abstract concepts, but the film plods along with sub par acting and jarring transitions, which makes the developing story feel incongruous. Maybe not to some, but I felt the Alanis Morrisette insertion as a key player was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. Not only was her performance phoned in, but her matter-of-fact, plot driven dialogue about the benevolent collective was delivered with the same practicality as a person talking about which brand of cigarette they prefer to smoke. It was just plain blah.Some of the concepts discussed between the protagonist and his author friend, were interesting ideas that at least hermetically tickled the neurons. The wife's role was merely to play the cynic, suffering from confirmation bias, tenaciously clinging to the palpable world, and illogically rationalizing the odd, miraculous happenings surrounding her husband. There were other game players, but most of the roles were filled by novice actors, incapable of pulling off their parts effectively. The special effects hearken back to the 70s artistic styling with psychedelic colors, an odd consortium of sounds, spiritual tableaus, and dreamy space capes, impressing both an expansive consciousness and hallucinatory motif.All in all, I was not overly pleased with this film, but considering the budget was limited, and I could see that the writer and director made an impassioned effort, I'll give it two and a half stars.;07 21, 2014;A16HYZDFVECK1D;Joseph Dicristofano;The Story Collapses Upon Itself;1405900800
